And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view.    I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement.    It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion.    I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities.    All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well. By recognizing our common humanity, our common loss, and our common goals, we can, in fact, work on this difficult problem.","Thank you.

Outside of Minneapolis, police shot and killed Philando Castile at what should have been a routine traffic stop. He was armed, but reports suggest that he repeatedly told police that he had a valid permit for the weapon.    In Dallas, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded seven others in what appeared to be a well-planned attack--this terrible act in the middle of an otherwise peaceful protest in a city that has become a model for community-engaged policing.

She seems to be always referring back to what the director has stated. However, with her being the attorney general I would hope she is a lot more knowledgeable than she appears in this hearing. In her position I would hope she would agree with the director's outcome or could have changed the outcome. Therefore, she is avoiding so that she is not under oath committing to any one answer. Witness answers that they have different roles and that is why he cannot provide the same level of detail. Witness does not say if there is legal reason for this, he does not say yes or no to the question."

You acknowledge that your bank fired over 5,300 people who got caught willfully defrauding your customers.

And I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference between ``gross negligence'' and ``extremely careless'' is unless one really wants to parse some words.    Now, secondly, the misdemeanor statute does not require intent. It's a strict liability statute, and it relates to the removal and retention of classified information. So it doesn't matter whether Secretary Clinton had the intent to do that or not; the fact is that the FBI said that she did it.

11530242059,110000,"Congresswoman, I understand your point, and it is my understanding we were in compliance with the safeguards rule and that the safeguards rule does not prevent 100 percent against data breaches.","Thank you.    Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.    So in my mind, this is the most open and shut violation of the safeguards rule that I have ever seen in the history of this country.

11420722064,100000,"Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.    And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","('somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'veryNegative')","('neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral')","('worker_51', 'worker_1', 'worker_41', 'worker_0', 'worker_20', 'worker_62', 'worker_30')","('neutral', 'attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'neutral', 'favor')",4, California, Attorney General  United States Department of Justice,0 -1 0 -1 -1 0 1,Democratic,1 1 1 0 0 1 -3,0 -1 -1 0 1 2 0,1 1 1 0 0 1 -1,Ms. Lofgren,1 0 0 1 1 0 0,0 0 2 3 1 1 0,1 2 4,1 1 1,2 3 2,0 -1 -1 0 1 1 0,1 1 1,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000000,4,"And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?",0,100000000000000000000000000,"This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.

11426003023,1000,"Ranking Member Waters, I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we have always known, as in any sales organization, you're going to have to be diligent, because not every team member will do everything right every day. So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.","Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states. That sales guide reminded employees of what should have been obvious, that they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?    That manual also said that sales practices that showed ``questionable activity'' would be sent via high priority to bank executives.

Earlier this year, I did make several recommendations to the White House, which were accepted, for important ways for dealing with this issue, ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers, ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities, such as trusts.    But also, as part of that, a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the information and the issues arising out of gun violence, as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy.","Well, what about that statement--never mind their position, but what do you think of the statement that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun?

11420722043,1,"Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed.

11420722029,100000,"Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair.

Madam Attorney General, I think the thing that I find so disheartening, so unfortunate, about FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week was that, for a lot of Americans, it looked like we're seeing a double standard, unequal treatment under the law.    Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.    Now, I assume that, based upon the way you've answered some of my colleague's questions prior to this, you're not going to acknowledge what I think virtually every other American believes, even her supporters, and that's to at least acknowledge, as Director Comey did, that she lied.

11426003139,1011,I don't have a precise count of that.,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.

11420722157,111000,"Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.","Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation.

11420722107,101000,"Well, thank you for raising this important issue, Congressman. I think that the issue of the training that we at the Department of Justice provide for law enforcement as well as the training generated in the field is of utmost importance. And I will tell you that as I have, in fact, traveled the country on my community policing tour highlighting departments that are working on this very issue, I've seen some outstanding examples, in particular, of de-escalation training using various scenarios to start, literally, with the mindset of the officer and how they respond to certain situations.    I have also been extremely encouraged by seeing law enforcement comment on many of the recent incidents that have been captured on video and talk about how training would or would not relate to those specific incidents. And I've been incredibly heartened by the growing sense of importance this issue has taken on within law enforcement itself. We have seen a number of, as I mentioned, of very, very positive programs involving training. We have seen, as I mentioned, not just the de-escalation but also training in the issues about the definitions of excessive force, the legal standards for excessive force. I have seen programs that break that down for officers, where we have seen----","Thank you very much. Last week, we saw more disturbing videos of police shooting of African-Americans, and we saw police officers killed in Dallas. And that was dreadful. The other side has made a point, my friends, to say people should know that nobody is above the law and all people are treated equally. Unfortunately, what we have seen is that African-Americans are not treated equally when it comes to deadly force and police officers in this country. And that's a more chilling reality than anything else that's been brought up here today. People's lives have been taken. This is a great problem. Black lives matter.    Congressman Lacy Clay and I put forward a bill last year, the Police Training and Independent Review Act, H.R. 2302, to address two of the major issues that have been identified as necessary to help improve the relationship of police and citizens. The bill would withhold a portion of Federal funding unless police are trained on a range of important issues like racial and ethnic bias and cultural diversity. I know the DOJ recently announced it would train all its office agents to recognize implicit bias, so I know you are aware of the need of training.    Our bill would also withhold a portion of Federal funding, unless police shootings that result in a death or injury are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted independently. Asking a local prosecutor to investigate the same law enforcement agency they work with and provide them with witnesses is implicitly wrong. Like Caesar's wife, an individual should be a prosecutor beyond the appearance of impropriety. If a prosecutor does everything right, the action can still appear biased.    If we are serious about restoring the sense of trust that we need to have with our citizenry, we need to eliminate this conflict of interest. As I know, as you've mentioned, a key part of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing calls for independent prosecutors. Campaign Zero, gaining a lot of credibility, also has called for the passage of this act. Congressman Clay and I have seen a surge of support. We now have 77 cosponsors.

Because what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina. It doesn't conform to what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis. I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina; we're grateful for it. But what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina.    I wanted to look at your code of conduct that you tout. So let's look at your code of ethics and business conduct. You said in your message as CEO, ``We are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards in how we conduct our business and serve our customers.''    The code of ethics, in fact, says, ``Our code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo and Company and its subsidiaries.'' It also says, ``We are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws.'' And, finally, ``It's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our company's code of ethics and business conduct and understanding that noncompliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.''    You clearly have failed. You've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally. You have broken, and your company has broken, longstanding law. You've broken longstanding ethical standards that you have within your company. This has nothing to do with this debate about Dodd-Frank or anything else. You've broken a longstanding law, and you've defrauded your customers.    How can you rebuild trust? And how can you get through this thing?

11386195047,100000,I have been informed that it is roughly 90 percent.,"Thank you.    And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy. Because an important part of homeland security is economic security, and our economic security is falling. The stock market is closing at the lowest level in a month. The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.    I do want to make an important point, that 195 Democrats have signed a petition saying that they will vote today, they will vote in 10 minutes, to open up the government.

11426003105,100000,"At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.    In the time remaining, let's get to the securities questions.
