You are right that every quarter each participant in the FOMC submits a projection of what they feel is going to happen in the economy and also their projection for appropriate monetary policy.

But since then, what we have seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy. We have seen continuing strength in the labor market. We have seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target.    We have also seen continued strength around the globe. We have seen fiscal policy become more stimulative.

It was amazing work by some really talented State Department officers to go out and collect that data. I think the data speaks for itself in terms of the horrific nature of what took place there.    With respect to making this legal determination, I am not prepared to provide you an answer today. Know that we are still looking at it, frankly, that I am still looking at that more specifically. My objective here is to get a really good outcome, to change this behavior, then to hold those responsible accountable. I want to make sure that we do this in a thoughtful way. I get the messaging that takes place when a Secretary of State makes these designations. I value that and it is important. But I think we would all agree the most important thing we can do is get both accountability and behavioral change, and that is what the State Department is working to do. We are still actively considering how to approach those conclusions.","Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate that.    I would like to move on at this point to Burma. A year and a half ago, the Burmese military drove the Rohingya out of the Rakhine State through a campaign of killings and rapes and burning of villages, and some of the most horrific and unspeakable crimes that we had seen on this globe in a long, long time. We all appreciated when then-Secretary Tillerson, your predecessor, dubbed these atrocities as ethnic cleansing. Now, as you know, ethnic cleansing is a powerful message, but it does not have legal weight.    And since 2017, overwhelming evidence has come out that clearly shows that the Burmese military committed crimes against humanity. Even the Department's own investigation into these atrocities came to similar conclusions. Several entities, including the House, have concluded that these crimes constitute genocide. The State Department has not made any legal pronouncement at this point beyond ethnic cleansing.    Given all the evidence available to you, could you comment today if you are ready to conclude or where you are in determining whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military did constitute at least crimes against humanity?","Given all the evidence available to you, could you comment today if you are ready to conclude or where you are in determining whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military did constitute at least crimes against humanity?","('veryNegative', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatNegative')","('neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral')","('worker_41', 'worker_62', 'worker_40', 'worker_44')","('neutral', 'attack', 'neutral', 'neutral')",1, Ohio, Hon.

11531349140,100000,"Thank you, Mr. Lucas. What we are doing right now is we are taking a careful look at the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. I think our view is that the leverage ratio is a very important requirement for banks, but it should be a backstop. It should be a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital.    I think that the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio that we put into place in, I guess 2013 in that range, went a little too far. It unfortunately seems to be deterring some low-risk wholesale-type activities that we really want financial institutions to engage in. One of those is client clearing, and particularly not counting margin.    But I think our way of addressing that is going to be, I think, to lower the calibration of the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio. That does seem to get done what needs doing there.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, I thank you for being here. Before I ask a general question and a broader question, I do note that I think you are my fourth Chairman to be able to visit within this environment since I have been a member of this committee.

My good colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Luetkemeyer has a bill regarding, and that is the supplemental leverage ratio clearing margin.    I know that Blaine's bill has strong bipartisan support from members of this committee and the Ag Committee.

11636001109,100000,"Congressman, I appreciate that question, and I know how Ohio has been dramatically affected by the opioid crisis. We have done a lot at the Department of Justice, and I would like to partner with this committee and I am sure General Barr would as well to combat and have additional tools to combat this opioid crisis. But some of the things that we have done is we set up in 2017 the Opioid Fraud and Detection Unit, which was a way that the Justice Department could utilize data to help combat the devastating opioid crisis. We did the largest healthcare fraud takedown in June of 2018. We set up the PIL Task Force, otherwise known as the Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force, in February of 2018. We set up a really innovative way called Operation SOS, which was Synthetic Opioid Surge. General Sessions and I went down to Tampa, Florida, where we saw Manatee County had taken an AUSA and embedded them once a week into the sheriff's office in order to take every fentanyl overdose case, and they dramatically reduced the number of overdose deaths in Manatee County. And we decided to take that model and apply it to the most affected States and districts that could really make a dramatic difference in saving lives.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Acting Attorney General, as you mentioned earlier, there are other important matters within the purview of the Justice Department and within the oversight responsibilities of this committee besides fishing expeditions, trying to get the goods on this President in an apparent effort to impeach him. For example, 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. I am old enough to remember back in the mid '80s when President Ronald Reagan and his wife felt so compelled to do something about the scourge of drugs in this country that the effort to just say no began and other efforts following that, and that was because back at that time, we had 10,000 deaths a year due to drug overdoses, and we now have over 70,000 deaths. So it is gotten, unfortunately, over time worse, not better. And most of the increase in deaths in 2017 were due to synthetic drugs, synthetic opioids specifically, like fentanyl, which accounted for a significant number of those deaths. This is clearly an epidemic which has been declared a state of emergency nationwide by the President and has deeply affected families in my home State of Ohio as well as families all across this Nation.    What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?","What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?","('somewhatNegative', 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'somewhatPositive')","('neutral', 'positive', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive')","('worker_20', 'worker_9', 'worker_0', 'worker_51', 'worker_1')","('attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'attack')",1, Ohio, Acting Attorney General  U.S. Department of Justice Oral Testimony,-1 0 -1 -1 -1,Republican,-1 2 0 -2 1,0 2 0 1 1,-1 1 0 -1 1,Mr. Chabot,0 1 1 1 1 1 0,0 0 0 2 2 1 0,2 1 2,1 1 1,0 2 3,0 1 0 1 1,0 1 1,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000000,2,"What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?",0,100000000000000000000000000,"This is clearly an epidemic which has been declared a state of emergency nationwide by the President and has deeply affected families in my home State of Ohio as well as families all across this Nation.

They have got millions of people crossing their border every day. They are not saying they are being invaded. There is no talk about building a wall. But, rather, they are calling for a coordination of humanitarian assistance and working within their group.    The fact of the matter is, in talking to some of the Colombian members of their government, I was talking to them not too long ago, yesterday to be a fact, they expect the possibility of a bigger crisis.

11525545069,100000,"Thank you, Congressman. I did not include that because I was hoping you would ask me the question. I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken. And when the motto is, ``Do right and feed everyone,'' I view that as very, very inclusive.","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. And I appreciated reading that your new motto at USDA is, ``Let's do right and feed everyone.'' I think we all hopefully share that goal.    I was a little surprised in your opening statement and in your written testimony I didn't see any mention of SNAP, which is the premiere anti-hunger program in this country. We have 42 million Americans who are food-insecure, who are hungry, many of them rely on this program to be able to put food on their table for themselves and their kids. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs we have. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at USDA who oversee and implement this program because it has one of the lowest error rates and fraud rates of any Federal program we have. We might want to consider lending some of those staff to the Department of Defense to oversee their defense contracting. They might get it better over there. But the bottom line is this is a good program. I worry because there is lots of talk, I have a bunch of articles that appeared in the last couple of weeks of Members of this body, and some people in the Administration, looking at SNAP as a place to basically try to find money to pay for other priorities; essentially, using it as an ATM machine, and that would be a mistake. We have heard talk of block granting SNAP, we have heard talk of putting more restrictions on the program, putting more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for people to be eligible for the program, which would be a mistake. The average amount of time that people are on this program is less than a year. And the benefit, I would argue, is inadequate. It is, on average, about $1.40 per person, per meal, which you can't buy a coffee for that nowadays.    My question to you is, and I am looking for some assurance here that; first, you are a strong defender of the program, that you are not advocating structural changes, or trying to put more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for poor people to get food, because it is a concern of a lot of people in this country.

11635589010,100000,"So, I am of the nature that I try not to contemplate failure too often, but we have certainly considered what the risks are associated with the efforts that we have provided to date and the efforts. Frankly, you mentioned the Lima Group, all the countries in the region now, some 50-some that have recognized the proper leader, as designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.    Look, we have seen Russia continue trying to exert influence. We know that the Cubans are providing substantial support to the Maduro regime. Allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome continued destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. It will certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos, the economic, and refugees flowing from those regions, from Venezuela to the region as well. So, there is lots of downside if the Venezuelan people's objective is not achieved.    Second, the day and week after is going to be a long process. The Maduro regime's destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months. This is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that is going to cost, I have seen estimates between $6 and $12 billion, and years to repair. So, the day after means making sure the Cuban and Russian influence are out; Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy. And the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them through this transition period.    The United States will certainly be part of it, but I am confident we will find the coalition that we have built, some 50 countries strong, that our State Department has built, will be part of that as well.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

He is interrupted before he can comment further, but this is a reasonable answer to Sherman's query. I am not sure if the senator made a comment, statement, or asked a question. Therefore, I am saying the witness answered the senator's question. Pompeo seems sincere but with limited information. Mike is saying that policy may change down the road if the hypothetical of Brad's question comes to pass."

And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view.    I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement.    It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion.    I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities.    All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well.

11525545003,100000,"It is wise, obviously. Sometimes, I guess, the saying we have in Georgia, ``When the mule is out the gate, it is too late to close the gate.'' You don't get that opportunity after an outbreak has occurred. You all are wise in considering a vaccine bank, whether it is foot-and-mouth disease, whether it is High-Path Avian Influenza.    I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Secretary, I want to let you know, and I think you know this, that I very strongly support the Chairman and the cotton industry, and finding a fix for them, and so whatever you can do to help, I will be there to help as well.    The Rural Development issue has caused some consternation here and there, but I take you at your word that you are going to continue to make that a priority, you are the Secretary, you decide how the Department should be run. And the only thing I would say is we are going to watch to make sure that Rural Development gets the same kind of emphasis that it always has. And you have said that, and I expect that will happen.    And another issue that I hope you and Secretary Ross, and I think you will, keep the Mexicans' feet to the fire on the sugar issue and try to get that resolved. So far you have been doing a great job with that.    One of the things that I went through here recently, we had a High-Path AI outbreak in my district, and the Department did a great job responding to it, and the state and everybody. I have had a firsthand look at this, and it is clear that the time to start a conversation with our trade partners regarding the use of vaccines to minimize the impact of High-Path AI doesn't need to happen during the course of the outbreak. It seems like what we do, but it needs to happen at a different time. That is when the trade impacts are the most damaging.

Before being confirmed as Attorney General in May of last year, you were first nominated by President Obama to serve as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and you were originally appointed to the U.S. Attorney post in 1999 by former President Bill Clinton.    The existence of Secretary Clinton's private email server was first brought to light in March of last year, 1 month before your confirmation as Attorney General. A few months after your confirmation, the inspectors general of State and National Intelligence requested the Department of Justice investigate whether classified information was stored on her private email servers. The FBI then opened an investigation into the matter.    Given that she was a political appointee of your current boss and, more importantly, the wife of your previous boss, why did you not see fit to recuse yourself from the investigation?

The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume.

But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents.

11635589012,100000,"So, the first thing we did is we identified it, something previous Administrations were loath to do. I get it. We have important economic interests with China. Many American jobs depend on that. President Trump is doing his level best to set the trade relationship so that it is fair and reciprocal. So, I would describe that as the first thing the Administration did.    The second thing is we recognize this is a great power battle and we are engaged in it across the world. It is our support of ASEAN. It is identifying the threat from Chinese State-owned enterprise technology companies, sharing that with countries in the Middle East and in Europe, identifying these risks, so that Western democracies around the world will wake up to the risks and will push back.    And you mentioned One Belt One Road, in particular. We are doing our best to make sure that there are Western competitors every place there is a project that China is putting forth. We are happy to compete. If it is fair, transparent, open transaction, you know, the Chinese may win a few, but I am very confident that American businesses will do incredibly well there.    What we have seen is just the opposite. We have seen transactions that were not straight-up, that were not fair, that were designed with a national security interest, and not an economic interest for the people of their country. The State Department has shared with these countries and their people and their leadership the risks from entering into these. And frankly, I think countries throughout Asia/Southeast Asia are waking up to this concern as well.","And thank you. I think it is an historic opportunity for the region, the hemisphere. I think it will transform Venezuela, which is now a failed State. It was a prosperous nation. Now, 20 years later, it is in utter chaos. And I think it would also impact Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia. It could really transform the Western Hemisphere and be a major foreign policy victory.    On China, as I get my threat briefings, Islamist terror has always been the focus, but it seems to me that China now is becoming more the No. 1 threat in nation States.

Based on Mr. Mulvaney's unceremonious dodging of the question, it seems that Chairman Hensarling's question would've made Mr. Mulvaney look bad, so he begins on a tangent to avoid the question. The witness seems to answer dodging the direct line of questioning to give relative context to their limited view. the person who answered answered with hesitation and seemingly unsure witness answers openly and honestly to question and provides additional information that helps provide vague but helpful extra detail Mulvaney states that there are exceptions to this, but it appears that he is confirming his jurisdiction to enforce all Federal consumer protection laws.

11531349027,101000,"Thank you, Chairman Barr. It is very hard to trace through the effects of a change in tax policy into things like wage growth in the economy. But let me try.    Lower corporate taxes should lead to higher investment. The effect is not easy to estimate but you would think and the studies find that it should lead to higher investment. Higher investment should lead to higher productivity over time, and higher productivity should lead to higher wages over time.    It is very hard to put your hands on exactly how much that would be, but higher productivity, of course, is very, very welcome, and will be driven by higher investment.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

11531504117,101000,"Congress has been very helpful in providing a small refinery exemption under the statute. It is objectively determined. It is 75,000 barrels, as you indicated, production and we have received I think 24 applications in 2017, a little bit over 30 in 2018. And I would say to you that the volatility of the RIN trading platform is creating instability across the entire RFS discussion.    So it is really in everyone's best interest to get more clarity and confidence in how this RIN trading platform and relief needs to occur. It is going to benefit the ethanol industry, benefit the ag sector, and I think benefit those that are suffering with the RIN obligations. And so it is our hope that we can chart a path forward with Congress to achieve those kinds of outcomes.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Administrator, for coming before us. I think that was the first policy question you got from the other side of the aisle. Observation.    And to the public, I think this has been a lot of a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that we are seeing too often here in Washington that, unfortunately, I think works against civility and respect for people in public office. I am hoping we would be able to stay on policy today as much as we could, but I can see some just can't resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand.    So, having said all that, I thank you for what you have done. You have been able to stay disciplined on these policies. I know in West Virginia the impact that it has had on Brownfields Legislation of what you are doing on that I see the rollback of some of the regulatory reform that there is hope now. A lot of the people in the fossil fuel industry that they could see that deterioration in the past 8 years prior to that. There is some hope. We are seeing the economy start to rebound thanks to you and the administration of taking this fight on.    So I know that if I could, I know just as an example, here was an example that despite what has been said to the achievements that you have made that the EPA just awarded $1.9 million to research in drinking water having to do with Flint, that research in Flint. People are ignoring the progress that we are making and they are trying to make this another attack on President Trump, and unfortunately there are a lot of people that are going to go along with that.

11635589079,100000,"So, you asked three questions there, I believe. The first one was what was my knowledge base. I think at that time I knew most of what had taken place, although I do not recall the exact sequence. I certainly have learned more about that since then. I have learned additional facts since that moment in time.    The second question was did I discuss the murder. The answer is yes. I think I said it that day, that I had discussed the murder with him.    And then, the third question is how will we hold them accountable. You have seen the Trump Administration do just that with respect to 17 individuals. We are continuing all across the government, certainly with overt means and all the tools that we have in our capacity, to learn more facts about this. President Trump has made very clear that we will continue to work to identify those who are responsible for Jamal Khashoggi's murder and hold them accountable. We will. I stand by that today. I am sure President Trump will as well.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome back, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for being here.    Mr. Secretary, I do not want to talk at a political level today with you. I want to talk from the heart. And I want to talk about a matter of justice on behalf of one of my constituents well known to you. I want to show you a picture.    This picture took place on November 19th, 2017 in my district. I am holding a cane because I had had a bad accident at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, a few months before and I still needed a cane to hobble around, not the most flattering picture of me.    Next to me is a man named Jamal Khashoggi. He is a mild-mannered man. He and I are discussing Middle East issues. He was a Saudi citizen, family, children, had on occasion worked for the Saudi government or for members of the royal family. He was mild-mannered, soft-spoken, and a moderate critic of the Kingdom. He wanted to see modernization. He wanted to see reforms. He was a columnist sometimes for The Washington Post, our local newspaper here in Washington.    On October 2d, 2018, 11 months later, my constituent, a legal resident of the United States who lived in Tysons Corner in Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia, was lured into the sovereign territory, the consulate of the Saudi government in Istanbul because he was seeking papers to get remarried. He had his fiancee outside waiting for him. He had been to the consulate before, and they had lulled him into believing he would be safe. But, of course, he was not.    What we know was that, on that day, two planes under the control of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia flew in with two teams whose objective was to either kidnap or kill Mr. Khashoggi. One presumes the objective involved killing because, not a diplomatic tool normally, they brought with them a bone saw. We know all of that because of revelations from Turkey. But those revelations, as I understand it, have been confirmed by our intelligence community; you would know better than I.    Nonetheless, what we do know is the Saudi government lied consistently. They lied about whether he safely left the consulate that day, knowing full well he did not. They lied about his murder. They lied about the conspiracy to murder him. They lied about who did it and how it was done.    And I guess I want to show you another picture, Mr. Secretary. This is a picture that took place 14 days after the murder. And that shows you and the Crown Prince, who many believe orchestrated and ordered the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, my constituent. And I guess what this picture raises is a question. At what point, as Americans, do we insist that the inalienable rights enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, all three of which were denied my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi, when do they trump diplomatic nicety? Is there ever a time when we are going to, as a country, insist, you know what, we are not going to do business as normal and we are going to hold you to account?    Now, at that meeting, you said, I believe, that they would be held to account, but you were meeting with a man who was assuring you they would be held to account, when he is himself suspected strongly of having orchestrated the murder. And so, I guess I want to ask you, Mr. Secretary, were you aware of the fact at that point of the gruesome details of the murder of my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi? Did you discuss that murder with the Crown Prince? And how are we going, moving forward, to hold the Crown Prince and the Saudi government responsible for one of the most grisly episodes ever to occur in a consulate or an embassy in our diplomatic experience?","And how are we going, moving forward, to hold the Crown Prince and the Saudi government responsible for one of the most grisly episodes ever to occur in a consulate or an embassy in our diplomatic experience?","('veryNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'veryNegative')","('neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatNegative')","('worker_41', 'worker_51', 'worker_62', 'worker_6')","('favor', 'neutral', 'attack', 'neutral')",3, Virginia, Hon.

You acknowledge that your bank fired over 5,300 people who got caught willfully defrauding your customers.

And thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being with us today.    You are in charge of the Department of Justice. The buck stops with you. And I'm concerned that you keep on saying that you have deferred the authority that by law is yours to Director Comey.    Let me give an example. Mr. Comey has said that Secretary Clinton was extremely careless in her handling of highly classified, very sensitive information. Now, the criminal statute uses the word ``gross negligence.'' And I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference between ``gross negligence'' and ``extremely careless'' is unless one really wants to parse some words.    Now, secondly, the misdemeanor statute does not require intent. It's a strict liability statute, and it relates to the removal and retention of classified information. So it doesn't matter whether Secretary Clinton had the intent to do that or not; the fact is that the FBI said that she did it.

And, Mr. Secretary, it is indeed good to see you.    And you mentioned a moment ago on some of the burning issues, let's talk about that for a moment. I think most of my colleagues are aware that in the early part of March this year, a series of wildfires burned over 1 1/2 million acres of land in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, and the Texas Panhandle. And these fires killed thousands of head of cattle, destroyed hundreds and hundreds of miles of fence, impacted countless families, businesses, and it is hard to estimate the impact on the smaller communities.    On the 4th of April, 2017, USDA authorized emergency grazing on Conservation Reserve Program lands located in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas for 90 days. The flexibility to graze on CRP was, and is critical to the survival of many operations throughout my district. And that being said, it will take longer than 90 days to regrow the foliage, rebuild the facilities needed to maintain, contain, and care for the surviving livestock. And last week I, along with Representative Marshall on this Committee, and Representative Thornberry, sent you a letter requesting extension of the emergency grazing authorization past the current 90 day authorization.

11531349059,1100,"Thank you. Of course when we are setting monetary policy we are focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment. In doing that, we consider many, many factors all around, the global economy, et cetera.    Fiscal policy changes can have an effect, and changes of this size can have an effect. That can be seen, of course, in the path to policy. It is very hard to say in advance what that would be, but the answer to your question is generally we take all those things into account.","Chairman Powell, welcome. As the Chair of our committee points out, you are required to be independent and accountable. You are also required to be tall and short.    Your opening statement mentions great exports. But you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by $60 billion in the last year. I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit. That is why the country elected Donald Trump President.    Now, the Chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017. He is right. We had Obama's fiscal policies, Obama's tax policies, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, Janet Yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet, and we had a great year.    As a matter of fact, we have been on a roll since 2011. We were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we would have a labor shortage and higher wages. We were going well, and so instead of continuing to be on a roll, we have abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy, throwing away the budget caps, $1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill.    But I think that we will still do well because our scientists, our entrepreneurs, and our workers are the best in the world, and they will make up for all the mistakes we are making here in Washington.    I see behind you, sir, the green shirts that call for full employment. It is not enough to go with the economists' definition of full employment, say 4 percent. We need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor.    That is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for 2 percent, but 2-1/2 percent inflation. That is the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now.    Now, when we talk about some workers getting a $1,000 bonus, yes, a few have, but a family of five's share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000. What greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country than that some charlatan can say, ``Here is the deal. I will give you $1,000. It is money in your pocket, and we will just slap a $26,000 mortgage on your future.''    Now, Chairman Powell, in your confirmation hearings, you said that, I believe, that no bank is any longer too big to fail. I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail; they would pull the entire economy down. We had to bail them out with $700 billion.    I would point out that the Wall Street prices into the value of the banks' stock, but more importantly, to the value of their unsecured debt, an implicit Federal guarantee, an assumption that they will be bailed out.    I have a number of questions for the record, but I will actually ask one for you to respond to. We have adopted these profligate fiscal policies.

11635589016,100000,Yes.,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary of State, thank you and welcome.    I want to talk a little bit about the Western Hemisphere and what is going on. I see a bigger plan in what is going on in Venezuela I think than most people. I see a lot of similarities of what happened with Cuba and what is happening in Venezuela. In Cuba, they allowed the people to leave that were disenchanted with the government. In Venezuela, there are 5,000 people leaving every day. They expect, by the end of this year, to be about 5 million people that have left Venezuela, those who are disenchanted with this government.    I really believe that there is a bigger plan here to destabilize the Western Hemisphere with what is going on in Venezuela. You have a million people putting a great deal of pressure on Colombia, and they have opened their doors and they have done a great job in helping these people. You have 700,000 people going into Peru. You have people all the way down to Argentina. Some of these countries cannot absorb the quantity of people that are leaving Venezuela daily. So, to me, I think this is part of a bigger plan to destabilize this whole region.    It continues to keep us busy. It continues to make America the bad apple in all this. And I would hope that we will continue to put pressure on Maduro. I do not believe in military action, but I do believe that sanctions will be effective and working with the Lima Group will be very effective.

Mr. Perdue, certainly, as another fellow veterinarian, as Mr. Yoho said, we are glad to have you, as a fellow farmer we are glad to have you, and I am sure General Bacon, who is sitting right in front of me, as an Air Force veteran, is glad that he has a fellow Air Force veteran sitting in your chair. We are so happy.    We certainly look for a close relationship. And for a man that, as Governor, stood on the Capitol steps during a severe drought and prayed for rain, and then shortly thereafter addressed record flooding, I definitely want to be closer to you if things go south.    So you have answered certainly most of my questions. The Chairman had one on the cottonseed issue, and that is very near and dear to me in Louisiana. The Ranking Member brought up the State Director of Rural Development and FSA, when they would be filled. And then Mr. Crawford brought up the practical to replant issue, which hit us right between the eyes in Louisiana with the flooding last year. I appreciate you addressing all those issues.    The quick question I do want to ask is that, with furrow irrigation rice, your agency has allowed that to become an insured crop, and in Louisiana we certainly appreciate that. As you know, with the furrow irrigated rice they tend to use the blast resistant seed. And for those here that don't know what that is, it is a fungus that affects rice and just devastates yields.

11525545065,101000,"I would be happy to, friend. First of all, let me talk about research just a second because you mentioned that. And you are absolutely right, the reason our producers are so productive today in the 21st century is because of the research and the foundation that has been laid. It is not something that can be cut off and on. And the other thing is the delivery system of that basic and applied research to the field through the extension service has been the wonder of the world, and we see what difference it has made in our productivity, and will continue to need to be as we have to feed nine billion people by 2050.    That is important, but you made a great point, another thing that is just as important is the technology, because you know your producers in middle and south Georgia are using technology for better water usage, better technology for precision agriculture, for monitoring crop needs; whether it is whatever adding, and the telemetry that is needed out there is dependent on wireless technology and WiFi. The other thing sociologically, Congressman, in today's world of connectivity, it might be true in your house with Wells' age, if the water goes off that is kind of a disadvantage, if your lights go off, oh, bummer, if your heat goes off you will get a blanket, but if your WiFi goes off that is a crisis. And that is kind of what happens out there in the world today is we are not sociologically, to Congressman Scott's point, we are not going to keep these young people on the farm attracted there if they don't have the connectivity they are used to when they go to college. They are not going to come back. And it is vitally important. The good news is this is square on the radar scope of the President, as well as the FCC Chairman. I have had conversations with him. He is anxiously awaiting the infrastructure plan where we can ambitiously take rural broadband ubiquitously across the country. As you know, there are places in our home state you can't even get a cell signal.    We have a lot of challenges, but I am convinced of what you hit on, it is the modern-day road, sewer, water of the 21st century is connectivity. And I look forward to promulgating as much of that as we can across the country.","Yes. I am not sure if you would be mending fence or checking cows right now if she hadn't agreed to marry you. You probably wouldn't be here.    Great man, great family, and what you will find from Sonny Perdue is, if he can help you, he will help you, and if he tells you he is going to do something, he is going to do it, and I have always appreciated that from you.    And, Governor, just a couple of quick comments and questions maybe. I was at the USDA research station in Byron this last week. As you know, research is not something that you can simply cut on and off; it is a long-term commitment, it is a long-term investment, and that investment has to be coupled with extension for it to actually get to the fields and help the farmers and our economy. And so they brought up while I was there the hiring freeze, and certainly hope that as we go forward we are able to come out from underneath that hiring freeze, and that you have the flexibility to put the people in the most effective areas with regard to research, and that that partnership will be there with the states, I know under you for the extension to actually get that research to the field.    Your commitment to 4-H, your commitment to FFA is something that also those two organizations are extremely important to rural America, and I know that those organizations will benefit from you being in that position as well.    One of the things that has changed on the farm in the last couple of years, and is changing at an exponential rate, is the use of technology. We know that President Trump will have an infrastructure program that will be put forward. The rural broadband, as you know, we need that, quite honestly, more than we need roads and bridges in many of the counties that I represent. You know from growing up in Houston County, you have metropolitan areas and then just a few miles down the road you have areas like you grew up in, in Bonaire, and I lived in Ashburn for a long time. I tell people I live in Tifton now but I actually live in Chula, Georgia. And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package?

And you also talked about the USDA stamp, it should be revered and trusted, and I agree, because that stamp around the world stands for the highest quality product that you can get, and it is so important that we protect it.    And several of the things I wanted to talk about were already talked about. Your understanding of FMD, it is music to my ears. There was a point up here where it wasn't talked about much, and we know the threat. We haven't had that here since 1929. If it comes here, it would be devastating. And certainly, we know what happened with BSE with the three cases that were here, and how long it is just now taking us to recover after 15 years. And that was with no depopulation of any of the herds. And certainly, if we had an FMD outbreak, it would be devastating. It would take years and years to recover, not just our cattle herd but our trade.    And as we look forward, I look forward to working with you on the new farm bill to make continued improvements in the cotton program, as was talked, but not at the expense of other crops, i.e., peanuts. I come from north central Florida, and the cottonseed program is something we talked about, to help give diversification to the cotton growers. And that is something that I hope you would consider looking at. But what we know is with these programs, you can't have one at the expense of the other one. And with peanuts, we certainly know within that one program you have discrepancy because you have the people that have generic and/or base acres, and then you have people that have neither, and they are growing peanuts right next to each other. One is at a disadvantage because they don't fall into a program. And we have seen people switch from cotton to grow peanuts because of the farm program. And there are some things that can be fixed in that, and I hope you will look at that. And not to penalize anybody, just to give that, I guess, parity on one peanut field to the next so that those farmers can stay in business, especially the young farmers that we see.    We have several things that we have put together. What I would like to do is having a meeting with you and maybe your staff, and go over some of the things.    And then coming from Florida, we have over 360 specialty crops in Florida. Florida is known for number one in the nation for melons, sweet corn, and citrus. Even with citrus greening, as Mr. Soto brought up, we went from 470 million boxes, we are down to under 70 million boxes. It is something that has to be dealt with, and we look forward to the robust funding that USDA has done.    And I guess one of my asks for you is, the research and development that we are doing is so vitally important, and again, USDA has been great on this, that we take that research and development, because we know one of the cures is probably going to be a GMO tree, to have the USDA help in marketing those products. And that is something I would like to see USDA get involved now to move to where we can start marketing that stuff.

11530242059,110000,"Congresswoman, I understand your point, and it is my understanding we were in compliance with the safeguards rule and that the safeguards rule does not prevent 100 percent against data breaches.","Thank you.    Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.

11389598095,110000,"No. I have done no investigations. I have read the IG's report that said inappropriate criteria were used to identify organizations for review. And the IG had nine recommendations, and we have accepted all of those recommendations.    I think it's important for the public to be confident that, whoever they are, they're going to be treated fairly by the IRS, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, belong to organizations of one kind or another. Wherever they show up, wherever they speak, they should understand they'll be treated fairly. If there's an issue, it's because something in their tax return; if somebody else had that issue, they would get the same response from the IRS.    I think it's critical that the public have that confidence, and we're doing everything we can to restore that confidence.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like Mr. Mica, John Koskinen, I have known you well before you came to Congress. Since coming to Congress, I have been impressed, not a little bit, by the confidence you have inspired in Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. It's as if they saved you for jobs that others couldn't do, didn't have the guts to do, or didn't have the integrity to do. You are well-known on both sides of the aisle as the government's most versatile turnaround artist. When an agency is in trouble, turn to John Koskinen.    Therefore, I begin my series of questions simply by offering you an apology. I believe you deserve one. You deserve one because of accusations designed to sacrifice the reputation of a public servant with a spotless reputation, for political advantage, without a scintilla--and I use my words advisedly--of evidence.    It's vile enough to look a man in the face and accuse him of perjury without submitting any evidence. It is much worse when all of the evidence supports the version of the facts of the man you are facing. Whether it is that the Lerner crash occurred well before this investigation began--she must be clairvoyant; whether it's been confirmed by the decriminalization lab, all the evidence is on your side, Mr. Koskinen.    And I want to point out for the record that the line of conspiracy hunting has shifted with the Lerner crash. For the longest time, the line of questioning was about one subject alone. So we've moved from one scapegoat to another. What we've just moved off of, the notion that this was all a conspiracy directed on behalf of the White House, that also without a crumb of evidence. Lacking evidence, the crash provides new fodder.

There is an investigation opened and started, and we don't just give----","Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note at the outset that, while the Hatch Act does not apply to--it does not Members of Congress. And it is always interesting to hear from my friends on the other side about the blending of political and official when every day we see examples of elected officials using their current positions to propel their Presidential campaign messages.    Having looked through the materials in preparation for this hearing, I can't help but feel that the Office of Special Counsel's interpretation of the Hatch Act means that President Trump's top advisers must subscribe to the legal and political fiction that you can decouple an opponent's Presidential campaign from their current elected position.    And my concern with the OSC's interpretation of the Hatch Act at least appears to be bipartisan. Chairman Cummings even sent a letter to OSC on December 7 of last year, and here's a direct statement: OSC's guidance is wrong. There is no limit that criticizing a policy of a sitting President or any other politician is a violation of the Hatch Act.    Apparently that applies unless you're an adviser to this President.    But all that aside, President Trump's advisers are going to continue to act as his surrogates. So going forward, maybe we can help--maybe this hearing can help us understand what a senior counselor to the President is allowed to say on TV or social media without personally offending Mr. Kerner or anybody else in the OSC's office.    So if we're talking about a sitting Senator and we're talking about Medicare for All, I mean, is it okay to say I hope Bernie Sanders Medicare for All proposal is purely campaign rhetoric, because if he were to introduce a Senate bill which actually provided a $32 trillion pay-for, people would have to give up the coverage they trust, and taxpayers would be on hook for trillions of dollars?

11420722064,100000,"Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.    And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","('somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'veryNegative')","('neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral')","('worker_51', 'worker_1', 'worker_41', 'worker_0', 'worker_20', 'worker_62', 'worker_30')","('neutral', 'attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'neutral', 'favor')",4, California, Attorney General  United States Department of Justice,0 -1 0 -1 -1 0 1,Democratic,1 1 1 0 0 1 -3,0 -1 -1 0 1 2 0,1 1 1 0 0 1 -1,Ms. Lofgren,1 0 0 1 1 0 0,0 0 2 3 1 1 0,1 2 4,1 1 1,2 3 2,0 -1 -1 0 1 1 0,1 1 1,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000000,4,"And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?",0,100000000000000000000000000,"This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.

Mr.Cole is given a simple answer and the few directions he could go wouldn't hurt how he is portrayed so it gives reason to wonder why he's acting confused. Witness says they do not have an answer and is then cut off mid-sentence. witness avoids answeing, claiming they don't know The senator has a very good point. A point that the witness obviously does not want any part in answering. It is a question the witness should be able to answer."

11532380118,110000,"Well, many States have capital punishment. The Federal Government has capital punishment for a number of offenses, and it is specifically controlled. We have within the Department a recommendation process through our appointed committee to seek or not seek a death penalty when a case is charged. Sometimes it's a complex thing.    But I believe the death penalty, the Federal death penalty, is a part of our law. I think it's a legitimate penalty. It's constitutional. And we will do our duty, even in those circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty.","Okay. It seems to me that there's always been a tremendous amount of gray area in that whole field, which I think, as a Nation, you know, we need to look much more closely at, both from the State's point of view and the Federal Government point of view. But that's just my feeling on that.    I'm running out of time. I had about four other things, but let me just go to one final thing here.    I've been very involved in the area of victims' rights. I was the--following Henry Hyde's leadership on this, introduced a victims' rights constitutional amendment years back, various pieces of legislation on victims' rights. And I've also worked closely with the parents of murdered children. And when you talk about something that affects one's family, there's nothing that affects a family more adversely than something like that happening.    And we still have capital punishment on the books, both at the Federal level and many of our States. Yet these families are dragged left and right, up and down, back and forth, into hearing after hearing. These cases can drag on for more than 20 years before the imposition of capital punishment actually occurs. And, in many instances, obviously, it never does.

11532380000,110100,"Mr. Chairman, as a former Federal prosecutor who emphasized gun prosecutions, I've long believed that they have a significant impact in reducing violent crime. Professors, earlier this year, have explained that they share that view based on scientific analysis. It will be a high priority of ours. You are correct that prosecutions fell.    One instance that was raised during the Texas--terrific, horrible shooting at the church there in Sutherland, Texas, was the ability of an individual to get a firearm and whether or not they filed correctly their form before you get one that--it requires questions about criminal convictions and court marshals.    Those prosecutions, I've noticed, have dropped by over 50 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. I think those are worthy prosecutions. And when a criminal is carrying a gun during a criminal act of some other kind, that is a clear and present danger to the public.

11531504000,111000,"Well, Mr. Chairman, I think both are important, and I do think there are some regulatory options that we can pursue. Many have talked about transparency as an example with respect to the trading platform and the RFS trading platform, how long you can hold a RIN as an example, who can buy, who can sell RINs. There are those kinds of, I think, evaluations that we can engage from a regulatory perspective. And, as you know, there is also consideration about the RVP waiver and the E15 being allowed year-round.    I think that is something, it is a legal determination. It is not a policy determination. And we have been earnest the last several months evaluating that in hopes that we can get to a conclusion on our ability to take those kinds of actions. But I really believe that Congress' role in this is terribly important because as you look at the issues that we are facing with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard and the viability of the RINs platform we need both Congress and our regulatory responses to be working together.","The gentleman yields back his time.

11636001038,1010,"Mr. Chairman, I see that your 5 minutes is up, and so--I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to a 5-minutes round, and----","I don't think you did, but let me just say this: Your iteration of the Department's longstanding policy appears designed to delay answering these questions as long as possible. I find that unacceptable. I understand the role of executive privilege and respect its value in our system of governance. However, Congress is a coequal branch of government. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight. This is a responsibility we take very seriously.    I have repeatedly tried to work with your office first in delaying the hearing until February and then in providing you our questions in advance. I did this because the executive branch's own rules governing assertion of privilege, which were issued by President Reagan and have been followed ever since, say that ultimately it is up to the President to decide whether or not he wants to assert executive privilege. You cannot repeat forever that the President might want to assert privilege.    I have given you a fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing and to speak with the White House in advance so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that. The Department's failure to do its due diligence here to me is deeply troubling. I do not believe that issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem, but I am going to give you the opportunity to rectify the situation.    After today's hearing, we will attempt to reach an accommodation with the Department to obtain answers to these questions. As part of that process, I ask for your commitment to return for a deposition before this committee in the coming weeks under oath with an understanding that the transcript will be released to the public as soon as practicable thereafter.    Any questions that are unanswered today or require consultation with the White House will be asked again at that proceeding, and I expect either a clean answer or a proper assertion of privilege claimed by the President. I would ask members on both sides of the aisle to make those questions clear for the record so we know what must be addressed at the future proceeding.

11525545000,100000,"Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.","Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.    The chair reminds Members they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the order of arrival, and I appreciate Members' understanding.    And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Secretary, again, thanks for being here, and we are looking forward to working with you across the myriad of issues that we have, going forward. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I represent a lot of cotton farmers. I believe we had a very elegant fix to the issue with respect to cotton, to the STAX program, that didn't work. It should have been in the omnibus bill, but our colleagues, particularly two of them in the Senate, refused to see the wisdom of that, and for their own purposes and own benefit, didn't let that happen. Now we are left with the same wreck in cotton. I hope I can count on working with you across whatever tools that we have. Obviously, we think that cottonseed could go under the title I program, and although there could be a lot of challenges with making that happen, we would look forward to working with you either on that or other issues with respect to getting some help to offset what China and India have done to the market, that will allow our producers to compete properly.    I would like to turn now to the Trade Under Secretary that you have announced. Obviously, as authorizers of the 2014 Farm Bill, we thank you very much for seeing the wisdom of that. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you see your Under Secretary working with the other array of trade entities, whether it is the USTR, Department of Commerce, whoever that might be, and the role that that Under Secretary would play, not only in making sure the negotiations go the correct way, but also making sure that the Administration keeps a close eye on enforcement of the various trade things that we have out there.

And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.

We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise?

All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.    There will be no change in the mission. We are realigning, in a closer family atmosphere where we can have a critical mass to help people better.","It is just the most amazing thing. The potential for that extension would have a tremendous impact upon my constituents.

11637282098,100000,That's correct.,"I thank the chairman.    I thank the witness for being here today appearing before the committee.    I would suggest to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, he must not be saying when he's saying that he's seeking one honest that everyone on this side of the aisle is somehow dishonest. I know that can't be the case, particularly when some of us have broken ranks, for example, offering and asking for a subpoena with respect to child separation policies.    But to suggest that we're somehow dishonest by saying you're seeking to find one honest man because we believe that this is a charade and a waste of the time of the American people, I think that that is a questionable direction to go.    And with respect to the Obama years, I would just raise that it would be awfully nice if my colleagues on the other side would recognize the President sent up a request for $762.8 million for ICE when the problem that we had on our border was nothing like it is today.

11426003023,1000,"Ranking Member Waters, I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we have always known, as in any sales organization, you're going to have to be diligent, because not every team member will do everything right every day. So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.","Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states. That sales guide reminded employees of what should have been obvious, that they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?    That manual also said that sales practices that showed ``questionable activity'' would be sent via high priority to bank executives. So it appears that you knew something in 2007, that unauthorized accounts were a big enough problem that you had to correct your employee manual.    And, as early as 2008, I have documents from court filings showing your employees were contacting your ethics hotline reporting bank fraud and complaining to managers over unauthorized accounts. And so it looks as if you certainly knew in 2008.    What's more, I have here a consent order with the Fed from 2011 that puts your company on watch for sales quotas and compensation schemes that pushed employees to break the law.

11635589125,101000,"Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.    As for what is going to be shared and released on conversations between the President and his foreign partners, the White House ultimately makes those decisions. And so, the inquiries would properly be lodged there.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us. Thank you for your service.    March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?","And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?","('veryNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'positive', 'somewhatNegative', 'veryNegative', 'neutral')","('negative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral')","('worker_6', 'worker_38', 'worker_0', 'worker_62', 'worker_30', 'worker_41', 'worker_51')","('favor', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'attack', 'favor', 'favor')",2, Florida, Hon.

It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, as you know, last Congress I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act, and President Trump signed it into law last March. The intention of this legislation was to allow our high-level officials to go to Taipei and to allow their high-level officials to come here to the United States, including Washington. In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations?

11420722043,1,"Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed.

11420722029,100000,"Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair. That, in and of itself, will go a long way toward restoring faith and trust in the overall criminal justice system, which is also a problem often raised to my attention during my travels.    So the Department looks forward to continuing to support those important efforts.","Thank you for your response.

11635589098,1001,I will have to look into it.,"Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.    In particular, we have seen your Assistant Secretary of State Chris Ford say the Department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of understanding, which do not require congressional oversight or approval, rather than through a one-two-three agreement.    And we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which in normal course are made available to the public, but are, instead, being kept secret, all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.    So, can I count on you and the Administration to release these six--they are called Part 810 authorizations--by the middle of this month?","So, can I count on you and the Administration to release these six--they are called Part 810 authorizations--by the middle of this month?","('negative', 'veryNegative', 'negative', 'neutral', 'negative', 'neutral')","('neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral')","('worker_30', 'worker_41', 'worker_44', 'worker_0', 'worker_6', 'worker_51')","('neutral', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'attack', 'neutral')",5, California, Hon.

Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.

I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy.

11426003139,1011,I don't have a precise count of that.,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.    So my question to you, Mr. Stumpf, first is, how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?","So my question to you, Mr. Stumpf, first is, how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?","('somewhatPositive', 'negative', 'negative', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'veryNegative', 'somewhatNegative')","('neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive')","('worker_20', 'worker_30', 'worker_9', 'worker_43', 'worker_0', 'worker_41', 'worker_8')","('attack', 'attack', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'attack')",5, Missouri, John G.

The witness answers the question as asked. Reminding that the information is available and not being hidden looks good for his side so reminding this would give strength to his side of case. Congressperson grandstands by requesting documents, and the witness says sure, but then points out that the docs are publicaly available, to illustrate the questioners grandstanding. Although I am not convinced the witness added that the information is public record in order to be helpful, I am sticking with it for now due to his straightforward answer."

11420722157,111000,"Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.","Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.

11525545120,101100,"One of the things that has not been talked about in our realignment, reorganization had to do with aligning NRCS and their mission area with FSA. That leaves NRE really with the responsibility of managing our U.S. Forest Service. That is where over 1/3 of the employees in USDA are, and that is, frankly, where some of the biggest challenges have come from. We face litigation, we face NEPA challenges, and other kinds of things in order to utilize the renewable resources on all of our millions of acres out here; northern California and many other states, to do that. Actually, that means jobs as well.    The good news, the fact is a healthy forest is less vulnerable to fire, and you all know that the fire budget has kind of gotten upside down in the Forest Service. We are spending more to fight fires than we are to prevent fires. We hope to get that corrected with your help and reestablished. But I believe, again, a mission area that is focused directly on utilizing the renewable aspects; whether it is deadfall going into biomass, or recovering these trees that might be down, they have a certain period of time that you can harvest them and they would be good lumber, to get ahead of that curve. The challenge is right now so much of that budget is spent in suppression rather than prevention, and we have to get ahead of that. But that is my desire.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Mr. Secretary. It is really great to have you here, and I hope things are going well for you in your transition. And it is also very heartening to hear the colleagues that you know the best; our Georgia colleagues, that have welcomed you here today, and the nonpartisan way which everybody likes working with you. That is a really good indicator compared to some of the things going on around this town.    There are so many issues here, and I am hoping, of course, that we see a rebound in ag commodities at the farm gate there, and then we can see exports are expected to come back up a little bit from a peak of just a few years ago.

11525545128,101000,"Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well.

The President has made clear he wants to put as few American soldiers' lives at risk as he possibly can and do so while achieving America's important policy interests. I think we can do that.    By the way, I have a senior State Department official who is working diligently to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 and to work with the Turks and with the Kurds to create conditions on the ground, in the real estate that separates Syria and Turkey, so that we can continue to maintain the vigilance that led to the destruction of the caliphate.    It is a longer answer, but this fits inside our policy throughout the Middle East, whether it is Iraq or in Syria, the work that we are doing to help Lebanon, the work we are doing with our Gulf partners to achieve precisely what it is I think you describe, a secure situation for the American people and an increase in the stability throughout the Middle East.","I just want you to know that I have here the OIG's email confirming that they have no problems with the Department providing these documents to Congress.

I do not want the United States to be in a foreign country any more than we have to, but pulling out of Syria would be a betrayal to the Kurds, our faithful allies for many, many years; saved American lives. It would create problems for our ally Israel because it would put the Iranian regime right on Israel's border. And if and when we ever had to come back, it would probably result in more American casualties. Right now, we seem to have the situation pretty much in hand.

11525545051,100100,"Well, as a veterinarian, I obviously understand the benefit of vaccination, and the fact that we cannot psychologically afford even a foot-and-mouth disease scare here at all. We saw what BSE did to us, and we talked about that earlier, but I want to compliment you on how well you listened in Iowa. I was delighted to be in your district, and to move up from the cows on the farm, a very innovative family farm operation there, up to the APHIS Ames facility. I was very impressed. We talked specifically about vaccine banks there. They are a repository, along with Iowa State, a USDA facility responsible for vaccination protocols as well. I am hopeful, I look at vaccine banks as insurance, and you can't have your house burn down and take out insurance after the fact and have it pay off. You have to have vaccines and you have to have a vaccine availability ahead of the time. I look at it as a wise insurance program.","I want to start out with a retraction of a statement that I made when I first heard of your name coming forward as Secretary of Agriculture, and I will say I thought it was candidly, but I said I hope it is more than about peaches and peanuts. And you came to Iowa 11 days after confirmation, and it was absolutely clear it is much, much more than about peaches and peanuts. And I was gratified to hear many of the things that you had to say there in the heart of my district. And I just wrote down a few of them here from memory. There will be a lot of colloquialisms that will come from our new Secretary of Agriculture, and it adds a lot of flavor to our rural life. For example, I am speaking of the trade that you grow it, we will sell it. I like that bumper sticker, and I have every confidence that will be the policy coming out of the USDA.    And now, one of the other things you said is an oath is stronger even than a contract. That stuck in my mind as the piece of wisdom that a lot of us can apply to our job here every single day. And let's see, the equipment might be a little different but the people are the same. That is another thing that is true all across this country, and it is something we can keep in mind here in this Agriculture Committee. And I will leave out the full story about the cow's tail, but that made it all real, Mr. Secretary.    So I wanted to welcome you to this Agriculture Committee, and I look forward to many discussions that we will have in the future years, and they will be very productive.    One of the things on my mind though as far as an issue is concerned is the fear of foot-and-mouth disease, and it is some of the things that we have been working on for I would say a year and a half or 2 years now in my district and beyond. That is the worst calamity we can imagine as far as biosecurity situation is concerned. I have been doing some work there through Iowa State, and the request that I see across the industry is for a vaccine bank that starts out at about $150 million, and then sells off some of that vaccine and keeps always a fresh supply there. We have another way to go where we can genetically design a vaccine that is going to be cheaper and can be reproduced more quickly.    You went up the road to APHIS and I wasn't able to tag along on that stop, but I wondered if you had any fresh thoughts on FMD and what you might be able to tell this Committee on how you would approach our preparations for potential calamity?","You went up the road to APHIS and I wasn't able to tag along on that stop, but I wondered if you had any fresh thoughts on FMD and what you might be able to tell this Committee on how you would approach our preparations for potential calamity?","('veryPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'positive', 'neutral')","('positive', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral')","('worker_39', 'worker_20', 'worker_2', 'worker_0', 'worker_8', 'worker_4', 'worker_41')","('attack', 'attack', 'favor', 'attack', 'favor', 'neutral', 'neutral')",1,, Hon.

11420722107,101000,"Well, thank you for raising this important issue, Congressman. I think that the issue of the training that we at the Department of Justice provide for law enforcement as well as the training generated in the field is of utmost importance. And I will tell you that as I have, in fact, traveled the country on my community policing tour highlighting departments that are working on this very issue, I've seen some outstanding examples, in particular, of de-escalation training using various scenarios to start, literally, with the mindset of the officer and how they respond to certain situations.    I have also been extremely encouraged by seeing law enforcement comment on many of the recent incidents that have been captured on video and talk about how training would or would not relate to those specific incidents. And I've been incredibly heartened by the growing sense of importance this issue has taken on within law enforcement itself. We have seen a number of, as I mentioned, of very, very positive programs involving training. We have seen, as I mentioned, not just the de-escalation but also training in the issues about the definitions of excessive force, the legal standards for excessive force. I have seen programs that break that down for officers, where we have seen----","Thank you very much. Last week, we saw more disturbing videos of police shooting of African-Americans, and we saw police officers killed in Dallas. And that was dreadful. The other side has made a point, my friends, to say people should know that nobody is above the law and all people are treated equally. Unfortunately, what we have seen is that African-Americans are not treated equally when it comes to deadly force and police officers in this country. And that's a more chilling reality than anything else that's been brought up here today. People's lives have been taken. This is a great problem. Black lives matter.    Congressman Lacy Clay and I put forward a bill last year, the Police Training and Independent Review Act, H.R. 2302, to address two of the major issues that have been identified as necessary to help improve the relationship of police and citizens. The bill would withhold a portion of Federal funding unless police are trained on a range of important issues like racial and ethnic bias and cultural diversity. I know the DOJ recently announced it would train all its office agents to recognize implicit bias, so I know you are aware of the need of training.    Our bill would also withhold a portion of Federal funding, unless police shootings that result in a death or injury are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted independently. Asking a local prosecutor to investigate the same law enforcement agency they work with and provide them with witnesses is implicitly wrong. Like Caesar's wife, an individual should be a prosecutor beyond the appearance of impropriety. If a prosecutor does everything right, the action can still appear biased.    If we are serious about restoring the sense of trust that we need to have with our citizenry, we need to eliminate this conflict of interest. As I know, as you've mentioned, a key part of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing calls for independent prosecutors. Campaign Zero, gaining a lot of credibility, also has called for the passage of this act. Congressman Clay and I have seen a surge of support. We now have 77 cosponsors.

11532380055,100000,I did chair that meeting.,"Thank you.    Now, I want to show you an image from March 31, 2016, of a meeting of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee, which you chaired, with yourself in attendance, along with then-candidate Donald Trump and Mr. George Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos pled guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI.    The charging papers filed by Special Counsel Mueller describe the March 31 meeting, where Mr. Papadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could help arrange a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to communicate with the Russian Government on behalf of the Trump campaign and appears to have told several senior campaign officials about it.    Now, here is the problem. On October 18 of this year, you said under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, quote, ``A continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian Government did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.''    Senator Franken asked, ``You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?'', to which you responded, ``I did not, and I'm not aware of anyone else that did,'' unquote.    Now, we now know that, one, the campaign had communications with the Russians through Mr. Papadopoulos and others, and, two, you seem to have been aware of the fact at the time.

It doesn't conform to what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis.

And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy. Because an important part of homeland security is economic security, and our economic security is falling. The stock market is closing at the lowest level in a month. The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.    I do want to make an important point, that 195 Democrats have signed a petition saying that they will vote today, they will vote in 10 minutes, to open up the government. And I feel if a vote was allowed on the floor, there would be enough like-minded Republicans that would vote, as we did on the Violence Against Women Act and other areas, jointly in a bipartisan way to open up our government.

But, again, the opportunity to deal with those kind of issues we have not specifically dealt with. I know a topic of interest and concern to you is CRP, I look forward to visiting with you again. I have not given specific directions. My comments about that is we can have some flexibility in the CRP program, maybe take out some of the least productive areas and use them rather than the whole-field type of philosophy we have had with CRP, give a little more flexibility in that way. With the wildfires we gave some flexibility regarding grazing on some of these areas as well. We want to be flexible while we maintain the integrity of the program, and help to train through FSA and NRCS our farmers to utilize their least productive acres; those that cost the most, and they may even have a better, higher net income if we don't try to plant wall-to-wall.",I believe that you have tasked the Farm Service Agency with looking at a revamp of the CRP program.

11525545059,110000,"Okay. Those are three important issues, and I would be happy to address all of them, if you don't mind. Again, from an RD perspective, I welcome the accountability. I am an outcome kind of guy. As I understand the current organizational chart, the Under Secretaries report to the Deputy Secretary, and I view the RD portion of this, particularly in limited resources, possibly with an infrastructure program from the Administration and you all. I am not a micromanager but I am a hands-on manager, and this is an area that Secretary Vilsack and I had wonderful conversations about how the potential of USDA has been used across the country in rural communities, both in water systems, both in utilities, and both in community facilities. This is something I guess I jealously wanted to be a part of. When I say elevated, I mean elevated to a portion where that person is going to be sitting close to me, with walk-in privileges over, this is a great opportunity, this is the deal, what do you think about, how can we do better to do that.    I welcome your oversight in the RD portion. The mission is not going to diminish whatsoever. The distribution network that has been developed out here with great people all over the country is not going to be diminished at all. The people in RD are going to report to this Assistant Secretary, who will have direct access to the Secretary, and I consider that an elevation. You can think about it as a nomenclature, but there was in no way a diminishment. If you gave me the opportunity in a corporation to have direct access to the CEO on walk-in privileges over ideas versus a title of a VP, give me that direct access anytime. That is the influence, that is the power, the access. That is the way I view the RD, and I look forward to your accountability in that.    NRCS' mission is not going to change, people aren't going to change. Maybe some locations might change from an economy of scale perspective, as I explained earlier. If we have disparate people and maybe two per office in different places, and we can combine there to have an economy of scale that makes a difference of service to our customers, we may consider doing that. In fact, there are actually preclusions about closing any places. If there is any combination of bringing the family into one house rather than being scattered out in a compound, then we look to have better service in that way.    Third, the advocacy and Secretary Vilsack had made a lot of progress in that. I don't see that diminishing whatsoever.","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Secretary, it was really good to hear you talk about feeding the world. That is very different from the President's budget which has cut almost every single feeding program, or zeroed them out. I am hopeful that you will win.    I am as well concerned, as my Ranking Member, about Rural Development. It is indicated in the reorganization plan that there would no longer be an Under Secretary; it was going to be elevated in some way. I am not sure how that is, except because the Under Secretary reports to you now, so I am not sure what that change is really going to be. But I am concerned, and certainly we will see how it goes as we move forward because, I tell you, you have been really busy in 4 short weeks. This is a major reorganization. I am just going to be watching, as is the rest of the Committee, to see how we progress with that.    Mr. Lucas raised the issue of NRCS, which I am also concerned about. And my first question to you is should we, in the future, look forward to seeing any kind of mergers within the agency or plans to close any of our NRCS offices?

I think she may be afraid it would make her look very negative within the investigation or make the investigation look more negative. Witness failed to answer the question."
11525545029,100000,"I would be happy to, Congressman. Again, what we see, I agree with you, I think an insurance program for our producers is a much more palatable safety net program from the public shareholder perspective than direct payments were. I thought you all made a lot of progress in 2014 in transitioning to that area of ARC, PLC, backed up with crop insurance, which put some responsibility on the producers themselves.    Now, that insurance program is not perfect, we have some things we need to readjust. There is, on cotton, for instance, the Chairman is interested in, we have a quality issue that the quality degradation is not right. We hope to adjust that.    The other thing that your producers may have, if they are on ARC, may have a county payment in one county, or might farm in both counties, and it is different and they don't quite understand those differences either as well. There is some fine tuning. Overall, the insurance program has been a great addition. We need to look at more specialty crops, how we can cover more specialty crops in that area and more. We don't want to create a program where our producers are farming for the program, and that happened in the past, and that creates some unnatural market forces that we don't want to have happen. We want a true safety net for those who are doing right, and we don't want people farming for insurance payments either, we want them farming legitimately. But the insurance ought to be utilized when there is a true revenue loss to that producer, be it be price, or be it be production, and how can we design that program.    You all had a great start, and we will look forward to working with you all as we go through the 2014 Farm Bill to make sure that the RMA program is even more effective, going forward. We know that the STAX program was not as helpful to the cotton producers as you all would have hoped, and the dairy program, certainly on some of those issues----","Yes, I hope so too. You might not remember, but about 3 years ago I was asked to make some remarks, it was the National Council of Farmer Co-ops in Hilton Head, and I remember this, after I had made my remarks you came up and introduced yourself and we had a nice little chat. And that is my only interaction so far I have had with you, and it was a good memory so I appreciate that.    I want to mention a couple of things: I want to also thank you for re-evaluating the School Lunch Program, bring some commonsense to that, and I wish somebody, and maybe it will be you, not only talk about the nutrition aspects but let's talk about exercise and activity. School-age kids can burn a lot of calories, and I don't think they are getting the activity and exercise like we used to when we were kids. It is good that we are putting, I guess we only have two percent milk, it is one percent or skim milk in the schools, and just some common sense and reasonableness. And I know my dairy producers will appreciate that in Ohio, we are a big dairy state.    Also I want to thank you too, on the regulatory side the Waters of the United States, some common sense in there, and working with Administrator Pruitt and the EPA to go back to the states, and work on a rule that addresses the Supreme Court decisions.    Also I want to ask a question, first of all, on the crop insurance. Do you have any thoughts how we can make crop insurance better and make it a more essential part of the safety net program, because as a policymaker, when I talk to non-farming public, you talk crop insurance the non-farming public can understand that better. And I would argue in a 10 year budget window, it probably isn't that much cost to the taxpayers, but it really helps in the years when we have a disaster, like a widespread drought. But on the revenue side and the weather side, can you maybe give us your thoughts of what we could do to make crop insurance even better, and it would work for the producers' aspect?","But on the revenue side and the weather side, can you maybe give us your thoughts of what we could do to make crop insurance even better, and it would work for the producers' aspect?","('neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral')","('neutral', 'positive', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral')","('worker_62', 'worker_1', 'worker_56', 'worker_20', 'worker_41', 'worker_0')","('neutral', 'favor', 'neutral', 'attack', 'favor', 'attack')",3, Ohio, Hon.

11525545019,1100,"Congressman Scott, you have identified some real challenges. You talked about the age issue, but those are particularly significant and disadvantage to opportunities as well."," Thank you very much.    Mr. Secretary, all of Georgia is very proud of you, and this nation will soon find out why. You are a wonderful, wonderful person, and we are delighted to have you as our Secretary of Agriculture.    Mr. Secretary, we are faced with a very serious national crisis, and that national crisis is the expanding age of our farmers. The average age of our farmers is right at 60 years of age. And we in this Committee have put together a bill to address that. It is House Resolution 51. Let me just tell you, we have been on this mission for over 2 years. It gives us an opportunity to utilize the 19 1890s African American land-grant institutions, which you are familiar with. Fort Valley is a case in Georgia. And you know the whole history of that. We were able to make sure that we had these land-grants.    You have the University of Florida, you have Florida A&M, and Prairie View in Texas, and so forth. The Presidents of these universities have come before this Committee and addressed this need. We have this bill. It is House Resolution 51. What it does is this. It will allow us to utilize these 19 1890s to address this issue and get our younger generation into farming, into agriculture. And more than that, agriculture is new farming, it is far beyond the mule and the plough from past; agriculture is a very sophisticated, technology-driven, science-driven engineering. These African American institutions have curricula applied to address what we refer to as STEM; science, technology, education, and math, at these.    What we want to do with this bill is to change some language in the farm bill which would, one, right now these universities can only spend the money we give them in education, research, and extension. But we want to change and add a fourth area that they could spend it in, which would be student scholarships. We have also set aside and we are working with the CCC, which is the Commodities Credit Corporation, to make sure we have the sufficient funds available. We are offering $1 million for each of the 5 years, for each of the 19 schools. That comes to $95 million. It is something that these universities who have been there in the fire, and have helped to find young people a way out of no options. And we have not exactly been efficient in applying funding, but this would be the area to do it.    I want you to know that this is a bipartisan bill. We have Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, as the sponsor on the Republican side, myself, several on this Committee; Ms. Fudge, Mr. Lawson, Ms. Adams, another Republican, Mrs. Mia Love out of Utah.    So what I want to ask of you, and I know you have been on 4 weeks, we want to make sure, we sent the bill to your staff, and certainly we want you to really get familiar with it and help us get this bill through our Committee here where it is now, onto the floor and to the Senate, and to the White House. We have been in touch with the White House. We are working with the Senior Legislative Director there, Marc Short. Marc is very familiar with it, and our Blue Dog Democratic meeting he and I talked about it. And President Trump is interested in this type of effort. And, of course, when you read it, if they haven't already informed you, the administration of this particular bill will be through the Department of Agriculture.    So we appreciate you. We can't get it done without your help here. And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?","And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?","('neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatNegative')","('positive', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral')","('worker_1', 'worker_41', 'worker_62', 'worker_56', 'worker_0', 'worker_63')","('favor', 'favor', 'attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'favor')",2, Georgia, Hon.

11525545134,101100,"Regarding the organic issue, certainly, that has become a valuable brand as we see the growth from consumers wanting more of that. The way the oversight works on that from USDA is we authorize or legitimize the certifiers; many times state agencies, to go out and make sure the principles and the processes and the programs that define organic are being carried out. As you might imagine, that is not a 24/7-type inspection. It works much like the Environmental Protection Agency authorizes state EPDs to work in that regard as well.    That is a challenge. Our goal is to have better education of these authorizing certifiers, and to maybe do some auditing out here, not only of the certifiers, but on the ground as well, to do that. We want to jealously guard the legitimate. And there is some legitimate concern regarding cheaters coming into the country with organic labels, that aren't following organic processes. It is a very important responsibility of USDA. We have to leverage that because there is no way for USDA to have enough inspectors on the ground everywhere to certify organics. But in working with our authorized certifiers, and we will just try to do a better job in making sure those people who are violating the rules are not allowed to continue to do that.","Well, we appreciate that.

So you'd have to refer to the specific facts of the other matters that you're referring to.    With respect to the investigation into the former Secretary's handling of classified information, her private email system, again, I can tell you and this entire Committee and the American people that all of the relevant facts were considered, investigated thoroughly, and reviewed by the entire team, which, again, is composed of career independent investigators as well as lawyers. And their recommendation, upon a full and thorough analysis, was that the matter be resolved in the way in which it was recommended to me.

You know, the fact is that, whether it's extremely careless or gross negligence and a strict liability of statute, I think that the language of the statute is clear.    Now, I've noted that the Justice Department over the last several years has prosecuted several servicemen for doing the exact same thing that Secretary Clinton did and, in one case, actually reached a judgment of a court that prohibited that serviceman from ever having a security classification again.    Now, you have a problem, Madam Attorney General, that people think that there's a different standard between the servicemen and Secretary Clinton and the fact that the language is almost synonymous, if not synonymous, saying no prosecution of Secretary Clinton and prosecution and conviction of the servicemen.    You have a burden, I think, to convince the American public that you don't have a double standard. You're not meeting the burden.

11525545197,101000,"Certainly. I smile because with your Western Growers the other day, we were talking about produce and melons and those kind of things, and we were talking about this very issue. And I said, well, when I grew up, we were a diversified row crop farm, but he loved truck farming, he loved melons, watermelons, cantaloupes, beans, and sweet corn, but I was his labor right there handling those watermelons, so I know what it takes to harvest them, and I know that it is very, very difficult to get domestic labor to do that any longer. And it is not really a matter of taking American jobs at any cost. We had a situation in Georgia where the legislature felt like they needed to have a tough immigration bill, and it really flushed out a lot of the harvest labor that we had there in Georgia. And there was an example where the Governor said we will let probationers do this, and so they did that for a day or so, but after about half a day the guys said can we go back to prison, because they just weren't willing to do that work. We understand it.    The good news is the President understands as well. This roundtable that we had, I think he understands the contribution that immigrant labor has made to our fields and farms, in processing and other things. We know from poultry processing and other things, there is a lot of immigrant labor.    When I said a way forward, I don't know that I can elaborate on the path today, but I have specifically hired a young woman who is a lawyer from Nebraska, who worked with Farm Bureau, whose expertise is in the farm labor. And what we want to do is to give to my boss in the Administration an opportunity and to thread the needle over this issue of how we utilize immigrant labor in this nation.    I believe the heart is there, the how-to and the process right now is what we have to figure out, but I can tell you, trade, labor, regulations are job one, two, and three.","Once again, my name is Jimmy Panetta. I represent the Central Coast of California; what my colleagues know as, based on my advertising, and I will tell you, the salad bowl of the world. We have plenty of specialty crops in that area. And this point I will be so brash as to personally invite you out to the Central Coast of California so that you can reinforce your understanding of specialty crops, and also what it takes to harvest these specialty crops. And what I mean by that, and what you know and what you have heard, is labor, and that has been an issue. Obviously, California, like Georgia, experienced some droughts, especially one in the past few years, excluding this year, thankfully. But even during that drought, the number one issue for our people in agriculture, especially on the Central Coast, was immigration, was labor force. And now, based on the political atmosphere in this country, based on the changing socioeconomic atmosphere in Mexico and southern Central America, and based on Congress' failure to do anything on immigration since 1986, it is not just an issue, it is an emergency. And I tell you, every single person that I speak to in agriculture, farmer to farmworker, they will tell you that the lack of labor force is the number one most pressing issue that they are facing right now, and it is an emergency situation.

The witness gives his explanation about how they go about ensuring all candidates get the same consideration to ensure diversity.He also adds that it doesn't mean someone diverse will get the job but their process ensures all candidates will be looked at equally. I do sense he is trying to sway opinion a little. But, for the most part I believe he is justifying there position on this matter. He answers the question about diversity but does specifically explain how it works because it's not a very strong process. He does give some information about the search firm but it's all vague. Mr. Powell is very clear in letting Ms. Waters know that they go to great lengths in selecting a reserve bank president. Including the fact that he has been involved with six reserve presidents already and knows the process well. Letting her know that looking at a highly diverse candidate pool is very important for all involved. Powell gives his thoughts on the diversity issue and answers the first question indirectly that the process (though not necessarily the candidate) is guaranteed to be diversified."

11531349044,101000,"I do think our post-crisis policies were effective. I haven't carefully studied that report yet, but let me say that what these reports try to do is they try to identify the surprise element in a particular Fed announcement and isolate that from what was already priced into the market.    Most things that happen on announcement day are already priced in. It is very hard to isolate that surprise element. This paper takes a different way of doing that, and it comes up with the answer that comes in.    Overwhelmingly, studies of the effects of asset purchase programs suggest that asset purchase programs did their job, which was to create downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through the term premium.

11531504107,101000,"If they provide the data and methodology to the Agency and the findings, it will be used.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Pruitt's ethical violations as the head of an Agency with a mission to protect the public's health demonstrate a concerning lack of integrity and a pattern of the rich and powerful putting their rich and powerful friends and their own self-interest above the interest of the public's health and at the expense of the common good. Clean air to breathe and safe water to drink is not a privilege only for the rich and powerful but a right for everyone, and the role of a public servant is to serve and protect the public, in particular the public's health.    However, the gross elimination of many public health protections are kickbacks to the rich lobbyists and corporation friends that have a real impact and I want to highlight one example. This week the EPA announced that it intends to limit the kind of scientific studies it will use in issuing new protections to only studies that make public the private, personal, confidential information of the people who participate in those studies.    Revealing that info is a clear ethical violation of any reputable research institutional review board in the United States. The type of studies you want to exclude are the same kind of scientific studies that were used to prove that lead in pipes and paints harm children and that secondhand smoke is a dangerous carcinogen. We are talking about landmark studies such as the Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study which proved a connection between air pollution and early death back in 1993. That just by living in a city with poor air quality your average life expectancy was lower than those who didn't. This study later became the basis of fine particulate matter regulations in the Clean Air Act.    When you were here in December, you and I spoke about fine particle matter which, thanks to studies based on confidential patient health information, we now know is associated with premature death, asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and respiratory diseases. You acknowledge these risks and agree that there is no safe level of fine particle pollution, but your new policy would block EPA from considering the studies that have shown these dangerous health implications.    So do you deny now that fine particle pollution has these health impacts, and will these new regulations cause your Agency to disregard these sentinel studies?","So do you deny now that fine particle pollution has these health impacts, and will these new regulations cause your Agency to disregard these sentinel studies?","('positive', 'veryNegative', 'veryNegative', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatPositive')","('somewhatPositive', 'somewhatNegative', 'negative', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral')","('worker_20', 'worker_30', 'worker_41', 'worker_51', 'worker_1', 'worker_62')","('attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'attack', 'attack')",1, California, Administrator  Environmental Protection Agency,-1 0 -1 -1 -1 -1,Democratic,2 -3 -3 -1 -1 1,1 -1 -2 -1 -1 0,1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1,Mr. Ruiz,1 0 1 0 1 1 0,0 1 3 1 1 0 0,4 0 2,1 0 1,4 1 1,1 -1 -1 -1 -1 0,1 1 1,0.9182958340544894,0.579380164285695,0.5,100000,1,"So do you deny now that fine particle pollution has these health impacts, and will these new regulations cause your Agency to disregard these sentinel studies?",1,010000000000000000000000000,"You acknowledge these risks and agree that there is no safe level of fine particle pollution, but your new policy would block EPA from considering the studies that have shown these dangerous health implications.

11426003105,100000,"At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.    In the time remaining, let's get to the securities questions.

However, I think this witness only gives this information to further explain why he has the opinion he has. Witness answers the question and adds that his answer is from two different experience perspectives. Answers the question adequately while providing background information about his experience in field to substantiate his claim."

When I graduated from veterinary school in 1971, I had volunteered for an assignment in the United States Air Force. I don't know that I realized that that would be a food safety and public health mission there. When I served in Ohio it was food safety and public health, and I learned a broad perspective of how important that was. The food safety industry and profession had not matured at that time in the 1970s, but I learned a lot about it, was trained in that area.    We have great veterinarians in our inspection services all over. And while you are correct, your veterinary school in Pennsylvania is one of the renowned ones, along with Iowa State, Kansas, and others, along with my alma mater, University of Georgia, have done a great job putting out professionals who are part of that food safety network. We have also got great career professionals in USDA under the guidance of veterinarians who are doing great work in that.    Much of the foodborne illness you see happens after that in the supply chain, delivery, in restaurants, and others, but we are committed to a zero tolerance policy to make sure that the food that Americans feed their families are safe.",Can you speak a little bit to that?,Can you speak a little bit to that?,"('neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'somewhatPositive')","('neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral')","('worker_41', 'worker_0', 'worker_43', 'worker_6', 'worker_9', 'worker_20')","('neutral', 'attack', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'attack')",4, Pennsylvania, Hon.

11531349065,100100,"Thank you, Mr. Royce. Of course we don't do fiscal policy at the Fed, but I will accept your invitation and just say that it is very important that the Federal Government and government generally be on a sustainable fiscal path, meaning as the baby boomer generation retires, we will need to address the significant fiscal issues that are coming to us over time. I think it is important that Congress do that.    At the same time, the debt ceiling should be something that we always raise in a timely fashion. There is no other country in the world that has a separate vote over whether to pay bills that we have already agreed to incur. I think the United States has never defaulted on a principal or interest payment and never should.    I think doing so would be something I would really hate to see and could bring very significant consequences.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being with us here today. I also wanted to thank you for another effort you undertook, and that was in 2011. You spent a considerable amount of time with members of the House, trying to walk them through the debate that we had on raising the debt ceiling.    You were trying to get us focused on all the unintended consequences, which would occur if we did not raise that debt ceiling, and I very much appreciated the time, effort, and facts that you put forward.    You have a new voice now at the Fed. I assume your opinions on the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling remain. I know that in August, it looks as though the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, or have to roll over, $500 billion of debt in August.    If we are in a quasi-default situation in August, then clearly it is a real question as who would want to purchase that debt and at what cost would they purchase that debt? Clearly a premium on that, a 10 percent premium, it would be a $50 billion hit right there to the interest expense, but there is much more than that that would befall the impact on our markets and, frankly, at corporate debt.

11525545203,101000,"I will, Congressman. Again, my mantra has been sound science, fact-based, data-driven, customer-focused decisions. And that is what we hope to do. That is a balance, obviously. As you know, today, we have used science in a way that sometimes comes from an ideological perspective, and the sound science definition is in the eye of the beholder. We have to make sure at USDA we have an agenda-less investigation, and things that come out without a predetermined conclusion over our scientific discovery that help us lead. I am not smart enough to create, intuitively, programs and policies without data, without science, without facts to do that. I agree with you.    The other part about that, when you talked about the agency that promulgated that, Secretary Price and I served in the state Senate. We have already talked about some interagency working between delineating FDA's role and USDA's role in some of these areas. The good news about the President's interagency task force over rural prosperity was, we get to talk about with different people how your rules affect my people, and how my rules may affect your people in that regard. We want to collaborate in a holistic approach to government, I think like I have not seen before; that is the Secretary of the Interior, FDA, HHS, Commerce and Energy, and those working together, the EPA Administrator. I told Scott Pruitt, I said my guys are much more excited about you than they are me, those folks are interagency.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, I am so glad to see that you are now the Agriculture Secretary. And everything I have read about you was excellent, and just hearing your testimony is really reassuring to me. I have always said it should be a prerequisite that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture should have a farm background. I know you have an excellent track record in farming and agribusiness, and I am looking forward to working with you.    I represent 35 counties in Kentucky, 35 rural counties, and there are six Congressional districts in Kentucky. And when you look at the total agriculture sales in Kentucky, the overwhelming majority of those sales come from the First Congressional District of Kentucky. We have poultry, we have beef cattle, corn, wheat, horses, and a lot of tobacco. Tobacco is still a very important crop in Kentucky.    My question is, in many instances the previous Administration promulgated regs that were unachievable. For example, the FDA pushed forward a proposed rule at the very last minute that would limit NNN, I am going to say it, N-Nitrosonornicotine, in smokeless tobacco to levels lower than growers could achieve. Will you commit to use sound, scientific data in rulemaking, and work with farmers and ranchers in drafting regulations to ensure that they are realistic and practical?","Will you commit to use sound, scientific data in rulemaking, and work with farmers and ranchers in drafting regulations to ensure that they are realistic and practical?","('neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'negative')","('somewhatNegative', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral')","('worker_41', 'worker_0', 'worker_15', 'worker_31', 'worker_44', 'worker_8', 'worker_30')","('favor', 'attack', 'attack', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'favor', 'neutral')",5, Kentucky, Hon.

11635589121,100000,"So, I have spoken to my Russian counterpart no less than three times on the issue of Venezuela and their interference, the fact that they are undermining Venezuelan democracy. It was met with precisely what you would expect from them.    We are doing our level best to push back against the capacity of Cuba, who has had intelligence officers and security officers on the ground there today protecting Maduro. It shocks me that the Venezuelan military will tolerate these foreigners, right, coming to run their security service. As a former U.S. Army officer, it would have been embarrassing if a third country had to come in and provide security for the leadership of our country. But that is where we are today.    We are doing our level best to put sanctions in place, to put restrictions in place, and to, more importantly, build our coalition, not just in South America and Central America with the OAS and the Lima Group, but European countries from all the around the world who understand that democratic Venezuela is the only path forward and Maduro has to go before we can get there.","And I am going to give a shoutout to you because I had the opportunity to travel with you for a better part of a day.
