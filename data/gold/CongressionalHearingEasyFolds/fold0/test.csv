11531349140,100000,"Thank you, Mr. Lucas. What we are doing right now is we are taking a careful look at the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. I think our view is that the leverage ratio is a very important requirement for banks, but it should be a backstop. It should be a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital.    I think that the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio that we put into place in, I guess 2013 in that range, went a little too far. It unfortunately seems to be deterring some low-risk wholesale-type activities that we really want financial institutions to engage in. One of those is client clearing, and particularly not counting margin.    But I think our way of addressing that is going to be, I think, to lower the calibration of the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio. That does seem to get done what needs doing there.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, I thank you for being here. Before I ask a general question and a broader question, I do note that I think you are my fourth Chairman to be able to visit within this environment since I have been a member of this committee.    I would like to discuss an issue with you today that you and I have already discussed. My good colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Luetkemeyer has a bill regarding, and that is the supplemental leverage ratio clearing margin.    I know that Blaine's bill has strong bipartisan support from members of this committee and the Ag Committee. In essence, it would offset those margin amounts for purposes of SLR because margin is inherently a risk management tool and legally must be kept separate from a bank's own funds.    The Fed can effect this change without legislation, however, and your predecessor showed a willingness to look at the issue.

11525545069,100000,"Thank you, Congressman. I did not include that because I was hoping you would ask me the question. I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken. And when the motto is, ``Do right and feed everyone,'' I view that as very, very inclusive.","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. And I appreciated reading that your new motto at USDA is, ``Let's do right and feed everyone.'' I think we all hopefully share that goal.    I was a little surprised in your opening statement and in your written testimony I didn't see any mention of SNAP, which is the premiere anti-hunger program in this country. We have 42 million Americans who are food-insecure, who are hungry, many of them rely on this program to be able to put food on their table for themselves and their kids. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs we have. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at USDA who oversee and implement this program because it has one of the lowest error rates and fraud rates of any Federal program we have. We might want to consider lending some of those staff to the Department of Defense to oversee their defense contracting. They might get it better over there. But the bottom line is this is a good program. I worry because there is lots of talk, I have a bunch of articles that appeared in the last couple of weeks of Members of this body, and some people in the Administration, looking at SNAP as a place to basically try to find money to pay for other priorities; essentially, using it as an ATM machine, and that would be a mistake. We have heard talk of block granting SNAP, we have heard talk of putting more restrictions on the program, putting more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for people to be eligible for the program, which would be a mistake. The average amount of time that people are on this program is less than a year. And the benefit, I would argue, is inadequate. It is, on average, about $1.40 per person, per meal, which you can't buy a coffee for that nowadays.

Frankly, you mentioned the Lima Group, all the countries in the region now, some 50-some that have recognized the proper leader, as designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.    Look, we have seen Russia continue trying to exert influence. We know that the Cubans are providing substantial support to the Maduro regime. Allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome continued destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. It will certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos, the economic, and refugees flowing from those regions, from Venezuela to the region as well. So, there is lots of downside if the Venezuelan people's objective is not achieved.    Second, the day and week after is going to be a long process. The Maduro regime's destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months. This is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that is going to cost, I have seen estimates between $6 and $12 billion, and years to repair. So, the day after means making sure the Cuban and Russian influence are out; Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy. And the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them through this transition period.    The United States will certainly be part of it, but I am confident we will find the coalition that we have built, some 50 countries strong, that our State Department has built, will be part of that as well.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Secretary, I want to let you know, and I think you know this, that I very strongly support the Chairman and the cotton industry, and finding a fix for them, and so whatever you can do to help, I will be there to help as well.    The Rural Development issue has caused some consternation here and there, but I take you at your word that you are going to continue to make that a priority, you are the Secretary, you decide how the Department should be run. And the only thing I would say is we are going to watch to make sure that Rural Development gets the same kind of emphasis that it always has. And you have said that, and I expect that will happen.    And another issue that I hope you and Secretary Ross, and I think you will, keep the Mexicans' feet to the fire on the sugar issue and try to get that resolved. So far you have been doing a great job with that.    One of the things that I went through here recently, we had a High-Path AI outbreak in my district, and the Department did a great job responding to it, and the state and everybody. I have had a firsthand look at this, and it is clear that the time to start a conversation with our trade partners regarding the use of vaccines to minimize the impact of High-Path AI doesn't need to happen during the course of the outbreak. It seems like what we do, but it needs to happen at a different time. That is when the trade impacts are the most damaging.

11388494029,100000,"Part of the process when this started, because there are literally millions of emails, was to take a look at, in agreement with the staffs of the investigating committees, take a look at 83, ultimately it was originally a smaller number, the IRS added to the custodians as it were, that is, the people sending and receiving emails, there are 83 of those that we agreed to look at. The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume. As I say, limiting the volume, you still have 700,000 pages of relevant documents. To the extent that somebody wants to look at hundreds of thousands more pages of what the search terms defined by the Congress would be termed irrelevant, at some point we are happy to provide those. We will provide those in the orderly course.    But I will tell you that our experience is it is going to be an overwhelming volume of materials. They will take us some significant time to redact taxpayer information, a significant part of which will have nothing to do with this investigation. But if that is the way the committee wants to go, we will go that way. But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents. Therefore, they suggested with us and selected with us search terms of what would be relevant: Tea Party, examinations, whatever else they picked. There are a whole series of those terms designed to limit the volume of materials.    We still have provided a lot of duplicative and probably irrelevant materials within those search terms, but we have not determined anything within those search terms. We have said if those are the terms that will help you winnow it down, we are happy to work with you. But if the committee wants to get simply large volumes of personal emails from a lot of different people, we will go through again, making sure that we redact those appropriately. As I say, we have provided unredacted copies of all of this in terms of the relevance determined by the committees to the other committees, and we provided all of the redacted information available now and we are continue to redact it.

Witness answered the question directly and provided more details to support his point It is hard to determine sometimes the motive of the witness for the answer they give. I think in this circumstance the witness added the information to explain why he answered the way he did. I feel he did explain it sufficiently. However, the senator may feel differently. The witness is also trying to be the judge of what the senator's want, as far as the emails they subpeoned. This suggests the witness may be avoiding a more serious question. Answers no directly and provides information regarding the question.",1
