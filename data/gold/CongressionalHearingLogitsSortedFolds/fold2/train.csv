11531504000,111000,"Well, Mr. Chairman, I think both are important, and I do think there are some regulatory options that we can pursue. Many have talked about transparency as an example with respect to the trading platform and the RFS trading platform, how long you can hold a RIN as an example, who can buy, who can sell RINs. There are those kinds of, I think, evaluations that we can engage from a regulatory perspective. And, as you know, there is also consideration about the RVP waiver and the E15 being allowed year-round.    I think that is something, it is a legal determination. It is not a policy determination. And we have been earnest the last several months evaluating that in hopes that we can get to a conclusion on our ability to take those kinds of actions. But I really believe that Congress' role in this is terribly important because as you look at the issues that we are facing with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard and the viability of the RINs platform we need both Congress and our regulatory responses to be working together.","The gentleman yields back his time.

11426003139,1011,I don't have a precise count of that.,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.

11530956047,110100,"Congressman, thank you. And let me say a couple of things on this. First, to your point about competition, the average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there is a lot of competition that we feel every day, and that is an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.    Second, on your point about regulation, the internet is growing in importance around the world in peoples' lives, and I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place for a lot of the reasons that you are saying.    I think a lot of times regulation, by definition, puts in place rules that a company that is larger, that has resources like ours, can easily comply with but that might be more difficult for a smaller startup to comply with.    So I think that these are all things that need to be thought through very carefully when thinking through what rules we want to put in place.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome to the committee.    A number of times in the last day or two you have indicated that, in fact, you are now open to some type of regulation. And we know, of course, that you are the dominant social media platform without any true competitor, in all frankness, and you have hundreds, if not thousands, of folks that are--would be required to help navigate any type of regulatory environment.

So you'd have to refer to the specific facts of the other matters that you're referring to.    With respect to the investigation into the former Secretary's handling of classified information, her private email system, again, I can tell you and this entire Committee and the American people that all of the relevant facts were considered, investigated thoroughly, and reviewed by the entire team, which, again, is composed of career independent investigators as well as lawyers. And their recommendation, upon a full and thorough analysis, was that the matter be resolved in the way in which it was recommended to me.

You know, the fact is that, whether it's extremely careless or gross negligence and a strict liability of statute, I think that the language of the statute is clear.

Now, you have a problem, Madam Attorney General, that people think that there's a different standard between the servicemen and Secretary Clinton and the fact that the language is almost synonymous, if not synonymous, saying no prosecution of Secretary Clinton and prosecution and conviction of the servicemen.

And you also talked about the USDA stamp, it should be revered and trusted, and I agree, because that stamp around the world stands for the highest quality product that you can get, and it is so important that we protect it.    And several of the things I wanted to talk about were already talked about. Your understanding of FMD, it is music to my ears. There was a point up here where it wasn't talked about much, and we know the threat. We haven't had that here since 1929. If it comes here, it would be devastating. And certainly, we know what happened with BSE with the three cases that were here, and how long it is just now taking us to recover after 15 years. And that was with no depopulation of any of the herds. And certainly, if we had an FMD outbreak, it would be devastating. It would take years and years to recover, not just our cattle herd but our trade.    And as we look forward, I look forward to working with you on the new farm bill to make continued improvements in the cotton program, as was talked, but not at the expense of other crops, i.e., peanuts. I come from north central Florida, and the cottonseed program is something we talked about, to help give diversification to the cotton growers. And that is something that I hope you would consider looking at. But what we know is with these programs, you can't have one at the expense of the other one. And with peanuts, we certainly know within that one program you have discrepancy because you have the people that have generic and/or base acres, and then you have people that have neither, and they are growing peanuts right next to each other. One is at a disadvantage because they don't fall into a program. And we have seen people switch from cotton to grow peanuts because of the farm program. And there are some things that can be fixed in that, and I hope you will look at that. And not to penalize anybody, just to give that, I guess, parity on one peanut field to the next so that those farmers can stay in business, especially the young farmers that we see.    We have several things that we have put together. What I would like to do is having a meeting with you and maybe your staff, and go over some of the things.    And then coming from Florida, we have over 360 specialty crops in Florida. Florida is known for number one in the nation for melons, sweet corn, and citrus. Even with citrus greening, as Mr. Soto brought up, we went from 470 million boxes, we are down to under 70 million boxes. It is something that has to be dealt with, and we look forward to the robust funding that USDA has done.    And I guess one of my asks for you is, the research and development that we are doing is so vitally important, and again, USDA has been great on this, that we take that research and development, because we know one of the cures is probably going to be a GMO tree, to have the USDA help in marketing those products. And that is something I would like to see USDA get involved now to move to where we can start marketing that stuff.

11420722157,111000,"Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.","Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.

11497630012,111000,"Well, Congressman, with respect to the types of cases that are prosecuted, as I indicated, a lot of the firearms prosecutions are done in conjunction with our violent crime program, and they may not show up in your statistics as the lead charges. They are a significant part of the arsenal that every Federal prosecutor utilizes.    Most recently, I've convened a summit with the top elected officials, police chiefs, and leaders of major cities to talk about violent crime that's currently taking place in several major cities, with a focus on finding the causes and finding the best ways to direct Federal resources to those particular cities.","Then why aren't they being prosecuted for those violations related to firearms?

Because what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina. It doesn't conform to what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis. I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina; we're grateful for it. But what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina.    I wanted to look at your code of conduct that you tout. So let's look at your code of ethics and business conduct. You said in your message as CEO, ``We are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards in how we conduct our business and serve our customers.''    The code of ethics, in fact, says, ``Our code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo and Company and its subsidiaries.'' It also says, ``We are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws.'' And, finally, ``It's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our company's code of ethics and business conduct and understanding that noncompliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.''    You clearly have failed. You've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally. You have broken, and your company has broken, longstanding law. You've broken longstanding ethical standards that you have within your company. This has nothing to do with this debate about Dodd-Frank or anything else. You've broken a longstanding law, and you've defrauded your customers.    How can you rebuild trust? And how can you get through this thing?

11525545120,101100,"One of the things that has not been talked about in our realignment, reorganization had to do with aligning NRCS and their mission area with FSA. That leaves NRE really with the responsibility of managing our U.S. Forest Service. That is where over 1/3 of the employees in USDA are, and that is, frankly, where some of the biggest challenges have come from. We face litigation, we face NEPA challenges, and other kinds of things in order to utilize the renewable resources on all of our millions of acres out here; northern California and many other states, to do that. Actually, that means jobs as well.    The good news, the fact is a healthy forest is less vulnerable to fire, and you all know that the fire budget has kind of gotten upside down in the Forest Service. We are spending more to fight fires than we are to prevent fires. We hope to get that corrected with your help and reestablished. But I believe, again, a mission area that is focused directly on utilizing the renewable aspects; whether it is deadfall going into biomass, or recovering these trees that might be down, they have a certain period of time that you can harvest them and they would be good lumber, to get ahead of that curve. The challenge is right now so much of that budget is spent in suppression rather than prevention, and we have to get ahead of that. But that is my desire.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

11525545134,101100,"Regarding the organic issue, certainly, that has become a valuable brand as we see the growth from consumers wanting more of that. The way the oversight works on that from USDA is we authorize or legitimize the certifiers; many times state agencies, to go out and make sure the principles and the processes and the programs that define organic are being carried out. As you might imagine, that is not a 24/7-type inspection. It works much like the Environmental Protection Agency authorizes state EPDs to work in that regard as well.    That is a challenge. Our goal is to have better education of these authorizing certifiers, and to maybe do some auditing out here, not only of the certifiers, but on the ground as well, to do that. We want to jealously guard the legitimate. And there is some legitimate concern regarding cheaters coming into the country with organic labels, that aren't following organic processes. It is a very important responsibility of USDA. We have to leverage that because there is no way for USDA to have enough inspectors on the ground everywhere to certify organics. But in working with our authorized certifiers, and we will just try to do a better job in making sure those people who are violating the rules are not allowed to continue to do that.","Well, we appreciate that.

But, again, the opportunity to deal with those kind of issues we have not specifically dealt with. I know a topic of interest and concern to you is CRP, I look forward to visiting with you again. I have not given specific directions. My comments about that is we can have some flexibility in the CRP program, maybe take out some of the least productive areas and use them rather than the whole-field type of philosophy we have had with CRP, give a little more flexibility in that way. With the wildfires we gave some flexibility regarding grazing on some of these areas as well. We want to be flexible while we maintain the integrity of the program, and help to train through FSA and NRCS our farmers to utilize their least productive acres; those that cost the most, and they may even have a better, higher net income if we don't try to plant wall-to-wall.",I believe that you have tasked the Farm Service Agency with looking at a revamp of the CRP program.

Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.    So in my mind, this is the most open and shut violation of the safeguards rule that I have ever seen in the history of this country.

So you have answered certainly most of my questions. The Chairman had one on the cottonseed issue, and that is very near and dear to me in Louisiana. The Ranking Member brought up the State Director of Rural Development and FSA, when they would be filled. And then Mr. Crawford brought up the practical to replant issue, which hit us right between the eyes in Louisiana with the flooding last year. I appreciate you addressing all those issues.    The quick question I do want to ask is that, with furrow irrigation rice, your agency has allowed that to become an insured crop, and in Louisiana we certainly appreciate that. As you know, with the furrow irrigated rice they tend to use the blast resistant seed. And for those here that don't know what that is, it is a fungus that affects rice and just devastates yields. And if they use that seed; that blast resistant seed, production goes up, yield per acre, and certainly water usage goes down, so it is a great thing.

11637282031,1001,"I'm not in a position to judge a statement like that. The way OSC works is we get complaints about statements. There is an investigation opened and started, and we don't just give----","Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note at the outset that, while the Hatch Act does not apply to--it does not Members of Congress. And it is always interesting to hear from my friends on the other side about the blending of political and official when every day we see examples of elected officials using their current positions to propel their Presidential campaign messages.    Having looked through the materials in preparation for this hearing, I can't help but feel that the Office of Special Counsel's interpretation of the Hatch Act means that President Trump's top advisers must subscribe to the legal and political fiction that you can decouple an opponent's Presidential campaign from their current elected position.    And my concern with the OSC's interpretation of the Hatch Act at least appears to be bipartisan. Chairman Cummings even sent a letter to OSC on December 7 of last year, and here's a direct statement: OSC's guidance is wrong. There is no limit that criticizing a policy of a sitting President or any other politician is a violation of the Hatch Act.    Apparently that applies unless you're an adviser to this President.    But all that aside, President Trump's advisers are going to continue to act as his surrogates. So going forward, maybe we can help--maybe this hearing can help us understand what a senior counselor to the President is allowed to say on TV or social media without personally offending Mr. Kerner or anybody else in the OSC's office.    So if we're talking about a sitting Senator and we're talking about Medicare for All, I mean, is it okay to say I hope Bernie Sanders Medicare for All proposal is purely campaign rhetoric, because if he were to introduce a Senate bill which actually provided a $32 trillion pay-for, people would have to give up the coverage they trust, and taxpayers would be on hook for trillions of dollars?

I visited with your Chairman and Ranking Member here, the Chairman and Ranking Member of Ag Appropriations to let them know of my plans and to do that.

11497630047,110000,"Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    This is, indeed, an important issue. Of course, we will always be deeply indebted to those first responders and brave men and women who risked their lives to search for and recover victims, to remove debris at the site, to carry out the recovery efforts at Ground Zero at 9/11.    It certainly is an important issue to me both as Attorney General and as someone who was in New York on 9/11 and who had friends and former colleagues who were in that group of those who were on the scene and who were involved in those activities. This is, in fact, a serious issue for those who were affected by it, and I greatly appreciate your expression of compassion for those who have fallen ill.    With respect to the bill that is currently pending, certainly, on behalf of the Department of Justice, we would do all that we could to work with you to make sure if there were any questions or issues they could be addressed. And we hope that there would be none.    This is, indeed, an important issue. And, again, I think it is something that deserves, certainly, strong review, serious consideration. And please let us know how the Department can be of assistance to any of the Members as they consider this important issue.","I thank the Chairman.    And I thank the Attorney General.    Madam Attorney General, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice established and oversaw a victims' compensation fund that provided more than $7 billion to families who lost loved ones on that day.    In the years after the attacks, it became clear that thousands of first responders and survivors continued to suffer major health consequences from the attacks and their aftermath. Thousands of lawsuits were filed against contractors and others by these victims.    In 2010, Congress enacted the James Zadroga Act, which provided essential healthcare services to those in need and reopened the Victim Compensation Fund to those families whose losses became apparent after September 11, providing them an alternative to litigation. In the last 5 years, the Victim Compensation Fund has provided nearly 6,300 first responders and survivors with $1.4 billion in compensation determinations. Since we enacted the bill, I am aware of no further 9/11-related lawsuits.    Despite its current success, on September 30, 2015, Congress allowed the VCF and the World Trade Center Health Program to expire. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in the House to permanently reauthorize the Victim Compensation Fund and the World Trade Center Health Program. The bill now has the cosponsorship of 247 cosponsors, a majority of the House, including more than 50 Republicans, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 65 cosponsors.    If Congress fails to act, thousands of first responders and survivors will lose access to compensation on which they depend to support their families when they are tragically gone. The VCF is preparing to shutter its operations once it has processed existing claims. If the VCF is not fully funded and reauthorized, the first responders and survivors who have already received the notice of their compensation could actually see that amount cut by up to 50 percent.

So even though you have already produced more than 400,000 pages to the committee, even though you have 250 employees working on producing more, he accuses you of violating your pledge and frustrating congressional oversight.

11420722027,100100,"Thank you, Congressman, for the opportunity to speak on these issues.    I believe that you have truly outlined the issue of the day facing our Nation. And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view.    I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement.    It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion.    I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities.    All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well. By recognizing our common humanity, our common loss, and our common goals, we can, in fact, work on this difficult problem.","Thank you.    Thank you for being here again, Attorney General, and thank you very much for your frank and candid discussion with us that is now taking place.    I'm looking for answers and views of some events that I'm going to string together and ask you to discuss as far as you can in an appropriate manner.    Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling. Video shows that he was shot while being pinned to the ground by two officers.    Outside of Minneapolis, police shot and killed Philando Castile at what should have been a routine traffic stop. He was armed, but reports suggest that he repeatedly told police that he had a valid permit for the weapon.    In Dallas, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded seven others in what appeared to be a well-planned attack--this terrible act in the middle of an otherwise peaceful protest in a city that has become a model for community-engaged policing.    And so I think you're qualified to advise us here, as both the chief law enforcement officer in the United States and the first African-American woman to hold that post.

11525545059,110000,"Okay. Those are three important issues, and I would be happy to address all of them, if you don't mind. Again, from an RD perspective, I welcome the accountability. I am an outcome kind of guy. As I understand the current organizational chart, the Under Secretaries report to the Deputy Secretary, and I view the RD portion of this, particularly in limited resources, possibly with an infrastructure program from the Administration and you all. I am not a micromanager but I am a hands-on manager, and this is an area that Secretary Vilsack and I had wonderful conversations about how the potential of USDA has been used across the country in rural communities, both in water systems, both in utilities, and both in community facilities. This is something I guess I jealously wanted to be a part of. When I say elevated, I mean elevated to a portion where that person is going to be sitting close to me, with walk-in privileges over, this is a great opportunity, this is the deal, what do you think about, how can we do better to do that.    I welcome your oversight in the RD portion. The mission is not going to diminish whatsoever. The distribution network that has been developed out here with great people all over the country is not going to be diminished at all. The people in RD are going to report to this Assistant Secretary, who will have direct access to the Secretary, and I consider that an elevation. You can think about it as a nomenclature, but there was in no way a diminishment. If you gave me the opportunity in a corporation to have direct access to the CEO on walk-in privileges over ideas versus a title of a VP, give me that direct access anytime. That is the influence, that is the power, the access. That is the way I view the RD, and I look forward to your accountability in that.    NRCS' mission is not going to change, people aren't going to change. Maybe some locations might change from an economy of scale perspective, as I explained earlier. If we have disparate people and maybe two per office in different places, and we can combine there to have an economy of scale that makes a difference of service to our customers, we may consider doing that. In fact, there are actually preclusions about closing any places. If there is any combination of bringing the family into one house rather than being scattered out in a compound, then we look to have better service in that way.    Third, the advocacy and Secretary Vilsack had made a lot of progress in that. I don't see that diminishing whatsoever.","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Secretary, it was really good to hear you talk about feeding the world. That is very different from the President's budget which has cut almost every single feeding program, or zeroed them out. I am hopeful that you will win.    I am as well concerned, as my Ranking Member, about Rural Development. It is indicated in the reorganization plan that there would no longer be an Under Secretary; it was going to be elevated in some way. I am not sure how that is, except because the Under Secretary reports to you now, so I am not sure what that change is really going to be. But I am concerned, and certainly we will see how it goes as we move forward because, I tell you, you have been really busy in 4 short weeks. This is a major reorganization. I am just going to be watching, as is the rest of the Committee, to see how we progress with that.    Mr. Lucas raised the issue of NRCS, which I am also concerned about. And my first question to you is should we, in the future, look forward to seeing any kind of mergers within the agency or plans to close any of our NRCS offices? And my second question relates to the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, which Congress put in place so that there would be an advocate on behalf of small, beginning, and minority farmers.

And the IG had nine recommendations, and we have accepted all of those recommendations.    I think it's important for the public to be confident that, whoever they are, they're going to be treated fairly by the IRS, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, belong to organizations of one kind or another.

I think it's critical that the public have that confidence, and we're doing everything we can to restore that confidence.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like Mr. Mica, John Koskinen, I have known you well before you came to Congress. Since coming to Congress, I have been impressed, not a little bit, by the confidence you have inspired in Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. It's as if they saved you for jobs that others couldn't do, didn't have the guts to do, or didn't have the integrity to do. You are well-known on both sides of the aisle as the government's most versatile turnaround artist. When an agency is in trouble, turn to John Koskinen.    Therefore, I begin my series of questions simply by offering you an apology. I believe you deserve one. You deserve one because of accusations designed to sacrifice the reputation of a public servant with a spotless reputation, for political advantage, without a scintilla--and I use my words advisedly--of evidence.    It's vile enough to look a man in the face and accuse him of perjury without submitting any evidence. It is much worse when all of the evidence supports the version of the facts of the man you are facing. Whether it is that the Lerner crash occurred well before this investigation began--she must be clairvoyant; whether it's been confirmed by the decriminalization lab, all the evidence is on your side, Mr. Koskinen.    And I want to point out for the record that the line of conspiracy hunting has shifted with the Lerner crash. For the longest time, the line of questioning was about one subject alone. So we've moved from one scapegoat to another. What we've just moved off of, the notion that this was all a conspiracy directed on behalf of the White House, that also without a crumb of evidence.

As the number one agricultural state, the diversity and the breadth and the width, we take great pride in the production in California, and I know you are aware of it. My California colleagues and I here on the dais would like to invite you sooner rather than later to come out to California where we could have a conversation with our farmers, ranchers, dairymen and women, and talk about the complexity of California agriculture.

We have agreed to a 5-minutes round, and----","I don't think you did, but let me just say this: Your iteration of the Department's longstanding policy appears designed to delay answering these questions as long as possible. I find that unacceptable. I understand the role of executive privilege and respect its value in our system of governance. However, Congress is a coequal branch of government. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight. This is a responsibility we take very seriously.    I have repeatedly tried to work with your office first in delaying the hearing until February and then in providing you our questions in advance. I did this because the executive branch's own rules governing assertion of privilege, which were issued by President Reagan and have been followed ever since, say that ultimately it is up to the President to decide whether or not he wants to assert executive privilege. You cannot repeat forever that the President might want to assert privilege.    I have given you a fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing and to speak with the White House in advance so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that. The Department's failure to do its due diligence here to me is deeply troubling. I do not believe that issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem, but I am going to give you the opportunity to rectify the situation.    After today's hearing, we will attempt to reach an accommodation with the Department to obtain answers to these questions. As part of that process, I ask for your commitment to return for a deposition before this committee in the coming weeks under oath with an understanding that the transcript will be released to the public as soon as practicable thereafter.    Any questions that are unanswered today or require consultation with the White House will be asked again at that proceeding, and I expect either a clean answer or a proper assertion of privilege claimed by the President.

11525545051,100100,"Well, as a veterinarian, I obviously understand the benefit of vaccination, and the fact that we cannot psychologically afford even a foot-and-mouth disease scare here at all. We saw what BSE did to us, and we talked about that earlier, but I want to compliment you on how well you listened in Iowa. I was delighted to be in your district, and to move up from the cows on the farm, a very innovative family farm operation there, up to the APHIS Ames facility. I was very impressed. We talked specifically about vaccine banks there. They are a repository, along with Iowa State, a USDA facility responsible for vaccination protocols as well. I am hopeful, I look at vaccine banks as insurance, and you can't have your house burn down and take out insurance after the fact and have it pay off. You have to have vaccines and you have to have a vaccine availability ahead of the time. I look at it as a wise insurance program.","I want to start out with a retraction of a statement that I made when I first heard of your name coming forward as Secretary of Agriculture, and I will say I thought it was candidly, but I said I hope it is more than about peaches and peanuts. And you came to Iowa 11 days after confirmation, and it was absolutely clear it is much, much more than about peaches and peanuts. And I was gratified to hear many of the things that you had to say there in the heart of my district. And I just wrote down a few of them here from memory. There will be a lot of colloquialisms that will come from our new Secretary of Agriculture, and it adds a lot of flavor to our rural life. For example, I am speaking of the trade that you grow it, we will sell it. I like that bumper sticker, and I have every confidence that will be the policy coming out of the USDA.    And now, one of the other things you said is an oath is stronger even than a contract. That stuck in my mind as the piece of wisdom that a lot of us can apply to our job here every single day. And let's see, the equipment might be a little different but the people are the same. That is another thing that is true all across this country, and it is something we can keep in mind here in this Agriculture Committee. And I will leave out the full story about the cow's tail, but that made it all real, Mr. Secretary.    So I wanted to welcome you to this Agriculture Committee, and I look forward to many discussions that we will have in the future years, and they will be very productive.    One of the things on my mind though as far as an issue is concerned is the fear of foot-and-mouth disease, and it is some of the things that we have been working on for I would say a year and a half or 2 years now in my district and beyond. That is the worst calamity we can imagine as far as biosecurity situation is concerned. I have been doing some work there through Iowa State, and the request that I see across the industry is for a vaccine bank that starts out at about $150 million, and then sells off some of that vaccine and keeps always a fresh supply there. We have another way to go where we can genetically design a vaccine that is going to be cheaper and can be reproduced more quickly.

And the President, as you know, has agreed with General Xi to reduce fentanyl and eliminate fentanyl production in China. And one of the ways that China has agreed to do that was by scheduling the analogs of fentanyl.

And one thing that I will end on here, just because I know we are running low on time, is, since the 2016 election, there have been a number of significant elections, including the French Presidential election, the German election, and last year the U.S. Senate Alabama special election.    And the AI tools that we deployed in those elections were able to proactively take down tens of thousands of fake accounts that may have been trying to do the activity that you are talking about. So our tools are getting better.    For as long as Russia has people who are employed who are trying to perpetrate this kind of interference, it will be hard for us to guarantee that we are going to fully stop everything. But it is an arms race, and I think that we are making ground and are doing better and better and are confident about how we are going to be able to do that.","OK.

The reason why we built the developer platform in the first place was because we thought it would be great if more experiences that people had could be more social. So, if you could have a calendar that showed your friends' birthdays, if you could have an address book that had pictures of your friends in it, if you could have a map that showed your friends' addresses on it.    In order to do that, you need to be able to sign into an app, bring some of your data and some of your friends' data, and that is what we built. Now, since then, we have recognized that that can be used for abuse too, so we have limited it so now people can only bring their data when they go to an app.    But that is something that a lot of people do on a day-to-day basis is sign into apps and websites with Facebook, and that is something that we are going----","All right.

Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.

Certainly, with respect to the existing state of the law, the Department of Justice is committed to fully following that. And the closure of Guantanamo Bay is being carried out in compliance with that law.    And so I believe that it is the view of the Department that we would certainly observe the laws as passed by Congress and signed by the President. Only very rarely would we take the step of finding that an unconstitutional provision was something that we could not manage.

11525545019,1100,"Congressman Scott, you have identified some real challenges. You talked about the age issue, but those are particularly significant and disadvantage to opportunities as well."," Thank you very much.    Mr. Secretary, all of Georgia is very proud of you, and this nation will soon find out why. You are a wonderful, wonderful person, and we are delighted to have you as our Secretary of Agriculture.    Mr. Secretary, we are faced with a very serious national crisis, and that national crisis is the expanding age of our farmers. The average age of our farmers is right at 60 years of age. And we in this Committee have put together a bill to address that. It is House Resolution 51. Let me just tell you, we have been on this mission for over 2 years. It gives us an opportunity to utilize the 19 1890s African American land-grant institutions, which you are familiar with. Fort Valley is a case in Georgia. And you know the whole history of that. We were able to make sure that we had these land-grants.    You have the University of Florida, you have Florida A&M, and Prairie View in Texas, and so forth. The Presidents of these universities have come before this Committee and addressed this need. We have this bill. It is House Resolution 51. What it does is this. It will allow us to utilize these 19 1890s to address this issue and get our younger generation into farming, into agriculture. And more than that, agriculture is new farming, it is far beyond the mule and the plough from past; agriculture is a very sophisticated, technology-driven, science-driven engineering. These African American institutions have curricula applied to address what we refer to as STEM; science, technology, education, and math, at these.    What we want to do with this bill is to change some language in the farm bill which would, one, right now these universities can only spend the money we give them in education, research, and extension. But we want to change and add a fourth area that they could spend it in, which would be student scholarships. We have also set aside and we are working with the CCC, which is the Commodities Credit Corporation, to make sure we have the sufficient funds available. We are offering $1 million for each of the 5 years, for each of the 19 schools. That comes to $95 million. It is something that these universities who have been there in the fire, and have helped to find young people a way out of no options. And we have not exactly been efficient in applying funding, but this would be the area to do it.    I want you to know that this is a bipartisan bill. We have Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, as the sponsor on the Republican side, myself, several on this Committee; Ms. Fudge, Mr. Lawson, Ms. Adams, another Republican, Mrs. Mia Love out of Utah.    So what I want to ask of you, and I know you have been on 4 weeks, we want to make sure, we sent the bill to your staff, and certainly we want you to really get familiar with it and help us get this bill through our Committee here where it is now, onto the floor and to the Senate, and to the White House. We have been in touch with the White House. We are working with the Senior Legislative Director there, Marc Short. Marc is very familiar with it, and our Blue Dog Democratic meeting he and I talked about it. And President Trump is interested in this type of effort. And, of course, when you read it, if they haven't already informed you, the administration of this particular bill will be through the Department of Agriculture.    So we appreciate you. We can't get it done without your help here. And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?","And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?","('neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatNegative')","('positive', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral')","('worker_1', 'worker_41', 'worker_62', 'worker_56', 'worker_0', 'worker_63')","('favor', 'favor', 'attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'favor')",2, Georgia, Hon.

And thank you, Attorney General. It's a pleasure to have you here, and I look forward to working with you, not only today, but in the months ahead.    As you likely know, I am on the Immigration Subcommittee and I follow closely what your Department is doing in that arena. Your predecessor, Attorney General Holder, testified in 2013 before the Senate, and this is a direct quote: ``It is inexcusable that young kids, 6, 7 year olds, 14 year olds, have immigration decisions made on their behalf against them and they're not represented by counsel.''    Now, in July of this year, the American Immigration Council and several other organizations filed a class action lawsuit in District Court in the Western District of Washington challenging the validity of removal proceedings for children without appointed counsel. And their argument was that an 8-year-old couldn't receive a full and fair hearing in the immigration court without representation.

11420722107,101000,"Well, thank you for raising this important issue, Congressman. I think that the issue of the training that we at the Department of Justice provide for law enforcement as well as the training generated in the field is of utmost importance. And I will tell you that as I have, in fact, traveled the country on my community policing tour highlighting departments that are working on this very issue, I've seen some outstanding examples, in particular, of de-escalation training using various scenarios to start, literally, with the mindset of the officer and how they respond to certain situations.    I have also been extremely encouraged by seeing law enforcement comment on many of the recent incidents that have been captured on video and talk about how training would or would not relate to those specific incidents. And I've been incredibly heartened by the growing sense of importance this issue has taken on within law enforcement itself. We have seen a number of, as I mentioned, of very, very positive programs involving training. We have seen, as I mentioned, not just the de-escalation but also training in the issues about the definitions of excessive force, the legal standards for excessive force. I have seen programs that break that down for officers, where we have seen----","Thank you very much. Last week, we saw more disturbing videos of police shooting of African-Americans, and we saw police officers killed in Dallas. And that was dreadful. The other side has made a point, my friends, to say people should know that nobody is above the law and all people are treated equally. Unfortunately, what we have seen is that African-Americans are not treated equally when it comes to deadly force and police officers in this country. And that's a more chilling reality than anything else that's been brought up here today. People's lives have been taken. This is a great problem. Black lives matter.    Congressman Lacy Clay and I put forward a bill last year, the Police Training and Independent Review Act, H.R. 2302, to address two of the major issues that have been identified as necessary to help improve the relationship of police and citizens. The bill would withhold a portion of Federal funding unless police are trained on a range of important issues like racial and ethnic bias and cultural diversity. I know the DOJ recently announced it would train all its office agents to recognize implicit bias, so I know you are aware of the need of training.    Our bill would also withhold a portion of Federal funding, unless police shootings that result in a death or injury are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted independently. Asking a local prosecutor to investigate the same law enforcement agency they work with and provide them with witnesses is implicitly wrong. Like Caesar's wife, an individual should be a prosecutor beyond the appearance of impropriety. If a prosecutor does everything right, the action can still appear biased.    If we are serious about restoring the sense of trust that we need to have with our citizenry, we need to eliminate this conflict of interest. As I know, as you've mentioned, a key part of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing calls for independent prosecutors. Campaign Zero, gaining a lot of credibility, also has called for the passage of this act. Congressman Clay and I have seen a surge of support. We now have 77 cosponsors.

11531504117,101000,"Congress has been very helpful in providing a small refinery exemption under the statute. It is objectively determined. It is 75,000 barrels, as you indicated, production and we have received I think 24 applications in 2017, a little bit over 30 in 2018. And I would say to you that the volatility of the RIN trading platform is creating instability across the entire RFS discussion.    So it is really in everyone's best interest to get more clarity and confidence in how this RIN trading platform and relief needs to occur. It is going to benefit the ethanol industry, benefit the ag sector, and I think benefit those that are suffering with the RIN obligations. And so it is our hope that we can chart a path forward with Congress to achieve those kinds of outcomes.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Administrator, for coming before us. I think that was the first policy question you got from the other side of the aisle. Observation.    And to the public, I think this has been a lot of a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that we are seeing too often here in Washington that, unfortunately, I think works against civility and respect for people in public office. I am hoping we would be able to stay on policy today as much as we could, but I can see some just can't resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand.    So, having said all that, I thank you for what you have done. You have been able to stay disciplined on these policies. I know in West Virginia the impact that it has had on Brownfields Legislation of what you are doing on that I see the rollback of some of the regulatory reform that there is hope now. A lot of the people in the fossil fuel industry that they could see that deterioration in the past 8 years prior to that. There is some hope. We are seeing the economy start to rebound thanks to you and the administration of taking this fight on.    So I know that if I could, I know just as an example, here was an example that despite what has been said to the achievements that you have made that the EPA just awarded $1.9 million to research in drinking water having to do with Flint, that research in Flint. People are ignoring the progress that we are making and they are trying to make this another attack on President Trump, and unfortunately there are a lot of people that are going to go along with that.    So if we could, if I could get back to one of the things that has disturbed me some with some of the events over the last numbers of years was we had a good friend in Leslie Lampton who passed away last week. Lampton has Ergon Refinery located in Mississippi but they have the only refinery in West Virginia. It is a small, kind of a boutique operation at 23,000 barrels. I know the definition of a small refinery is 75,000 barrels, so they are a third of the size. But yet, so they are struggling meeting all of the qualifications, all the requirements of a major refinery.    Is there something that we could work together or something to help out these small refineries so that they can compete?

11525545203,101000,"I will, Congressman. Again, my mantra has been sound science, fact-based, data-driven, customer-focused decisions. And that is what we hope to do. That is a balance, obviously. As you know, today, we have used science in a way that sometimes comes from an ideological perspective, and the sound science definition is in the eye of the beholder. We have to make sure at USDA we have an agenda-less investigation, and things that come out without a predetermined conclusion over our scientific discovery that help us lead. I am not smart enough to create, intuitively, programs and policies without data, without science, without facts to do that. I agree with you.    The other part about that, when you talked about the agency that promulgated that, Secretary Price and I served in the state Senate. We have already talked about some interagency working between delineating FDA's role and USDA's role in some of these areas. The good news about the President's interagency task force over rural prosperity was, we get to talk about with different people how your rules affect my people, and how my rules may affect your people in that regard. We want to collaborate in a holistic approach to government, I think like I have not seen before; that is the Secretary of the Interior, FDA, HHS, Commerce and Energy, and those working together, the EPA Administrator. I told Scott Pruitt, I said my guys are much more excited about you than they are me, those folks are interagency.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, I am so glad to see that you are now the Agriculture Secretary. And everything I have read about you was excellent, and just hearing your testimony is really reassuring to me. I have always said it should be a prerequisite that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture should have a farm background. I know you have an excellent track record in farming and agribusiness, and I am looking forward to working with you.    I represent 35 counties in Kentucky, 35 rural counties, and there are six Congressional districts in Kentucky. And when you look at the total agriculture sales in Kentucky, the overwhelming majority of those sales come from the First Congressional District of Kentucky. We have poultry, we have beef cattle, corn, wheat, horses, and a lot of tobacco. Tobacco is still a very important crop in Kentucky.    My question is, in many instances the previous Administration promulgated regs that were unachievable. For example, the FDA pushed forward a proposed rule at the very last minute that would limit NNN, I am going to say it, N-Nitrosonornicotine, in smokeless tobacco to levels lower than growers could achieve.

11525545128,101000,"Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well.

There was a lot of disappointment over the TPP with only opening up another 50,000 tons, which I and about seven other growers could grow that ourselves.

11525545197,101000,"Certainly. I smile because with your Western Growers the other day, we were talking about produce and melons and those kind of things, and we were talking about this very issue. And I said, well, when I grew up, we were a diversified row crop farm, but he loved truck farming, he loved melons, watermelons, cantaloupes, beans, and sweet corn, but I was his labor right there handling those watermelons, so I know what it takes to harvest them, and I know that it is very, very difficult to get domestic labor to do that any longer. And it is not really a matter of taking American jobs at any cost. We had a situation in Georgia where the legislature felt like they needed to have a tough immigration bill, and it really flushed out a lot of the harvest labor that we had there in Georgia. And there was an example where the Governor said we will let probationers do this, and so they did that for a day or so, but after about half a day the guys said can we go back to prison, because they just weren't willing to do that work. We understand it.    The good news is the President understands as well. This roundtable that we had, I think he understands the contribution that immigrant labor has made to our fields and farms, in processing and other things. We know from poultry processing and other things, there is a lot of immigrant labor.    When I said a way forward, I don't know that I can elaborate on the path today, but I have specifically hired a young woman who is a lawyer from Nebraska, who worked with Farm Bureau, whose expertise is in the farm labor. And what we want to do is to give to my boss in the Administration an opportunity and to thread the needle over this issue of how we utilize immigrant labor in this nation.    I believe the heart is there, the how-to and the process right now is what we have to figure out, but I can tell you, trade, labor, regulations are job one, two, and three.","Once again, my name is Jimmy Panetta. I represent the Central Coast of California; what my colleagues know as, based on my advertising, and I will tell you, the salad bowl of the world. We have plenty of specialty crops in that area. And this point I will be so brash as to personally invite you out to the Central Coast of California so that you can reinforce your understanding of specialty crops, and also what it takes to harvest these specialty crops. And what I mean by that, and what you know and what you have heard, is labor, and that has been an issue. Obviously, California, like Georgia, experienced some droughts, especially one in the past few years, excluding this year, thankfully. But even during that drought, the number one issue for our people in agriculture, especially on the Central Coast, was immigration, was labor force. And now, based on the political atmosphere in this country, based on the changing socioeconomic atmosphere in Mexico and southern Central America, and based on Congress' failure to do anything on immigration since 1986, it is not just an issue, it is an emergency. And I tell you, every single person that I speak to in agriculture, farmer to farmworker, they will tell you that the lack of labor force is the number one most pressing issue that they are facing right now, and it is an emergency situation.

I do want to ask a couple questions about the Superfund program, particularly about your friend Mr. Albert Kelly, who you put in charge of the program despite his past. He was scheduled to appear before the committee in January, but he backed out at the last minute, citing travel obligations. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were disappointed in that, but Mr. Kelly sent a letter for the record that he would be willing to answer any and all of our questions regarding his lifetime ban from the banking industry and the illegal activities that led up to that.    It is now more than 3 months later, we have gotten no information from Mr. Kelly. We are told that political leadership has been preventing him from speaking with us, and if that is true, that is certainly disappointing. Two weeks ago, you were interviewed on Fox News by Ed Henry, and he asked you several questions about Mr. Kelly. In the interview, you said that the details of the settlement with the FDIC were private, and that none of us really know what happened.

The question is what have they been asked to do by their leadership. And one of the things I have asked the staff to pay closer attention to, moving forward, is the cost benefit analysis. I was, quite frankly, surprised, Mr. Luetkemeyer, by the amount of qualitative cost benefit analysis that was done. In fact, my background is in numbers, economics, commerce, finance. I didn't realize you could do qualitative cost benefit analysis. I thought cost benefit analysis was supposed to be quantitative.

11635230127,101000,I don't expect I'm going to have a source of income when I'm in Federal penitentiary.,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Jordan.    The chairman and this committee have promised members of the American people a fair and open process, yet the Democrats have vastly limited the scope of this hearing. They issued a gag order to try to tell members of this committee what we can and cannot talk about.    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that they want the truth, that they want transparency and fair oversight, yet the Democrats' witness to testify before Congress today is none other than a scorned man who is going to prison for lying to Congress.    Let that sink in. He is going to prison for lying to Congress, and he is the star witness to Congress.    If you read the sentencing report on Mr. Cohen words like ``deceptive'' and ``greedy'' are scattered throughout that report. It paints a picture of a narcissist, a bully who cannot tell the truth, whether it is about the President or about his own personal life. But today he is the majority party's star witness.    If the Democrats were after the truth, they'd have an honest person here testifying. And if they were really after the truth, they'd not restrict the questioning to just a few topics. But let's take a look at those restricted topics.    Mr. Chairman, the first topic in your limited scope that I can ask Mr. Cohen is about the President's debts. But, Mr. Chairman, didn't Mr. Cohen plead guilty to lying to banks about his personal finances? So we are asking a guy going to jail for lying about his debts to comment about the President's debts. He is the expert.    Mr. Chairman, your next couple of topics say that I can ask Mr. Cohen about the President's compliance with financial disclosures and campaign finance laws. But didn't Mr. Cohen on two occasions break campaign finance law with his own donations? So again, the majority party's star witness on the President's compliance is a guy who broke compliance laws himself.    Mr. Chairman, you graciously allow us to ask questions of Mr. Cohen on the President's dealings with the IRS and tax law. Your star witness here broke the law with regards to the IRS at least five times. He pled guilty on cheating on his taxes, lying to the IRS. He's the best witness you got?    Next up, with the permission of the chairman I get to ask Mr. Cohen about his perspective on the President's business dealings. Let me get this straight. The witness lied to multiple financial institutions to get loans to pay off other loans just to keep himself afloat, and he is going to be the expert on business practices.    Obviously, Mr. Chairman, the witness may produce documents that he suggests incriminates the President, yet he lies to banks. All of those lies were done on fraudulent documents, documents that he forged. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. Apparently he even lied about delivering his own child, which his wife had to correct the record.    Ladies and gentlemen, how on earth is this witness credible? With all the lies and deception, the self-serving fraud, it begs the question, what is the majority party doing here? No one can see this guy as credible. He will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. He is a fake witness, and his presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people see through this. I know the people back in Tennessee will.    And with that statement, sir, I have a few questions for the witness.

11525545065,101000,"I would be happy to, friend. First of all, let me talk about research just a second because you mentioned that. And you are absolutely right, the reason our producers are so productive today in the 21st century is because of the research and the foundation that has been laid. It is not something that can be cut off and on. And the other thing is the delivery system of that basic and applied research to the field through the extension service has been the wonder of the world, and we see what difference it has made in our productivity, and will continue to need to be as we have to feed nine billion people by 2050.    That is important, but you made a great point, another thing that is just as important is the technology, because you know your producers in middle and south Georgia are using technology for better water usage, better technology for precision agriculture, for monitoring crop needs; whether it is whatever adding, and the telemetry that is needed out there is dependent on wireless technology and WiFi. The other thing sociologically, Congressman, in today's world of connectivity, it might be true in your house with Wells' age, if the water goes off that is kind of a disadvantage, if your lights go off, oh, bummer, if your heat goes off you will get a blanket, but if your WiFi goes off that is a crisis. And that is kind of what happens out there in the world today is we are not sociologically, to Congressman Scott's point, we are not going to keep these young people on the farm attracted there if they don't have the connectivity they are used to when they go to college. They are not going to come back. And it is vitally important. The good news is this is square on the radar scope of the President, as well as the FCC Chairman. I have had conversations with him. He is anxiously awaiting the infrastructure plan where we can ambitiously take rural broadband ubiquitously across the country. As you know, there are places in our home state you can't even get a cell signal.    We have a lot of challenges, but I am convinced of what you hit on, it is the modern-day road, sewer, water of the 21st century is connectivity. And I look forward to promulgating as much of that as we can across the country.","Yes. I am not sure if you would be mending fence or checking cows right now if she hadn't agreed to marry you. You probably wouldn't be here.    Great man, great family, and what you will find from Sonny Perdue is, if he can help you, he will help you, and if he tells you he is going to do something, he is going to do it, and I have always appreciated that from you.    And, Governor, just a couple of quick comments and questions maybe. I was at the USDA research station in Byron this last week. As you know, research is not something that you can simply cut on and off; it is a long-term commitment, it is a long-term investment, and that investment has to be coupled with extension for it to actually get to the fields and help the farmers and our economy. And so they brought up while I was there the hiring freeze, and certainly hope that as we go forward we are able to come out from underneath that hiring freeze, and that you have the flexibility to put the people in the most effective areas with regard to research, and that that partnership will be there with the states, I know under you for the extension to actually get that research to the field.    Your commitment to 4-H, your commitment to FFA is something that also those two organizations are extremely important to rural America, and I know that those organizations will benefit from you being in that position as well.    One of the things that has changed on the farm in the last couple of years, and is changing at an exponential rate, is the use of technology. We know that President Trump will have an infrastructure program that will be put forward. The rural broadband, as you know, we need that, quite honestly, more than we need roads and bridges in many of the counties that I represent. You know from growing up in Houston County, you have metropolitan areas and then just a few miles down the road you have areas like you grew up in, in Bonaire, and I lived in Ashburn for a long time. I tell people I live in Tifton now but I actually live in Chula, Georgia. And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package? I would appreciate your comments on that.","And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package?","('positive', 'veryPositive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatNegative')","('somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'negative')","('worker_4', 'worker_39', 'worker_2', 'worker_0', 'worker_41', 'worker_20', 'worker_8')","('neutral', 'attack', 'favor', 'attack', 'favor', 'attack', 'neutral')",5, Georgia, Hon.

I think that we also have to look at the root causes of the violence. As I indicated in a response to an earlier question, just last month I convened a summit on violence of several of the leaders of our major cities--police chiefs and mayors, as well as police executives. And what the Department is doing is looking for ways to identify the root causes of so much of the violence that we are seeing.    Even as violence is at historic lows nationwide, we still have some communities that struggle with this issue. In some instances, it is gun violence. In some instances, we see an increase in drug use--methamphetamines, heroin, opioids. And so we are trying to find our best ways to focus our resources there.

11420722043,1,"Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''?

11497630029,101000,"Thank you, Congressman.    With respect to the Department's enforcement of our various civil rights statutes, it is certainly robust and will continue to be so. While we no longer have the advantage of the preclearance provisions that were in the Voting Rights Act, we still have significant provisions of the Voting Rights Act that allow us to review actions and decisions taken, albeit after the fact, to determine whether there has been either a discriminatory intent or, as is very often the case, a discriminatory result.    We can engage in negotiation and conversations. Many times, we do that before we even move to litigation in an attempt to reason with or have a discussion with entities that are making significant changes. And often those discussions are very productive. I was pleased to see that, after discussions with Members of Congress, the State of Alabama may be making some modifications to those changes. And, certainly, those types of discussions are an efficient way to bring about change and raise these important issues.    But I will reiterate, Congressman, that the Department of Justice is committed to enforcing the civil rights laws that we do have on the books. And we are committed to a vigorous review of matters that are brought to our attention and will ensure full and fair and efficient review of those matters and take the action that is appropriate.","Thank you.

And I actually would like to thank you and the other Members of this Committee for the important work that you've done on this issue.    As you have noted, this legislation is critical to continued law enforcement sharing of information from the U.S. and the European Union. In fact, I have been involved in discussions with ministers from the European Union on the Data Protection Act, often called the Umbrella Act, as well as the Judicial Redress Act.    It certainly is our view that this important legislation should be passed. It would provide, as you know, redress for European Union citizens should there be an unauthorized or misuse of their data here in the U.S., which is a privilege enjoyed by U.S. citizens within the European Union.    Without this, we do have a grave risk of not having the completion of the data protection or umbrella agreement. And I think, sadly, recent events have shown us the importance, the critical nature, of making sure that we have these safe and secure portals for transferring information from one law enforcement entity to another.","Okay.

Administrator Pruitt's ethical violations as the head of an Agency with a mission to protect the public's health demonstrate a concerning lack of integrity and a pattern of the rich and powerful putting their rich and powerful friends and their own self-interest above the interest of the public's health and at the expense of the common good. Clean air to breathe and safe water to drink is not a privilege only for the rich and powerful but a right for everyone, and the role of a public servant is to serve and protect the public, in particular the public's health.    However, the gross elimination of many public health protections are kickbacks to the rich lobbyists and corporation friends that have a real impact and I want to highlight one example. This week the EPA announced that it intends to limit the kind of scientific studies it will use in issuing new protections to only studies that make public the private, personal, confidential information of the people who participate in those studies.    Revealing that info is a clear ethical violation of any reputable research institutional review board in the United States. The type of studies you want to exclude are the same kind of scientific studies that were used to prove that lead in pipes and paints harm children and that secondhand smoke is a dangerous carcinogen. We are talking about landmark studies such as the Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study which proved a connection between air pollution and early death back in 1993. That just by living in a city with poor air quality your average life expectancy was lower than those who didn't. This study later became the basis of fine particulate matter regulations in the Clean Air Act.

So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.","Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states. That sales guide reminded employees of what should have been obvious, that they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?    That manual also said that sales practices that showed ``questionable activity'' would be sent via high priority to bank executives. So it appears that you knew something in 2007, that unauthorized accounts were a big enough problem that you had to correct your employee manual.    And, as early as 2008, I have documents from court filings showing your employees were contacting your ethics hotline reporting bank fraud and complaining to managers over unauthorized accounts. And so it looks as if you certainly knew in 2008.    What's more, I have here a consent order with the Fed from 2011 that puts your company on watch for sales quotas and compensation schemes that pushed employees to break the law.

And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy. Because an important part of homeland security is economic security, and our economic security is falling. The stock market is closing at the lowest level in a month. The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.

11525545069,100000,"Thank you, Congressman. I did not include that because I was hoping you would ask me the question. I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken. And when the motto is, ``Do right and feed everyone,'' I view that as very, very inclusive.","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. And I appreciated reading that your new motto at USDA is, ``Let's do right and feed everyone.'' I think we all hopefully share that goal.    I was a little surprised in your opening statement and in your written testimony I didn't see any mention of SNAP, which is the premiere anti-hunger program in this country. We have 42 million Americans who are food-insecure, who are hungry, many of them rely on this program to be able to put food on their table for themselves and their kids. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs we have. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at USDA who oversee and implement this program because it has one of the lowest error rates and fraud rates of any Federal program we have. We might want to consider lending some of those staff to the Department of Defense to oversee their defense contracting. They might get it better over there. But the bottom line is this is a good program. I worry because there is lots of talk, I have a bunch of articles that appeared in the last couple of weeks of Members of this body, and some people in the Administration, looking at SNAP as a place to basically try to find money to pay for other priorities; essentially, using it as an ATM machine, and that would be a mistake. We have heard talk of block granting SNAP, we have heard talk of putting more restrictions on the program, putting more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for people to be eligible for the program, which would be a mistake. The average amount of time that people are on this program is less than a year. And the benefit, I would argue, is inadequate. It is, on average, about $1.40 per person, per meal, which you can't buy a coffee for that nowadays.    My question to you is, and I am looking for some assurance here that; first, you are a strong defender of the program, that you are not advocating structural changes, or trying to put more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for poor people to get food, because it is a concern of a lot of people in this country.

Because of the budget constraints the agency was operating with 2 years ago, the decision was made not to proceed.","Well, what is correct?","Well, what is correct?","('neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'veryNegative')","('negative', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatNegative')","('worker_62', 'worker_9', 'worker_0', 'worker_42', 'worker_51', 'worker_16', 'worker_30')","('neutral', 'neutral', 'attack', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'attack')",2, California  Chairman, Commissioner  Internal Revenue Service ,0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1,Republican,0 0 0 0 0 1 -3,-2 2 0 0 1 -1 -1,0 0 0 0 0 1 -1,Chairman Issa,1 0 0 1 1 0 0,0 1 2 2 1 1 0,1 5 1,1 1 1,3 2 2,-1 1 0 0 1 -1 -1,1 1 1,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000000,4,"Well, what is correct?",0,100000000000000000000000000,"Well, what is correct?","Well, what is correct?","Well, what is correct?","Well, what is correct?","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[7.207118511199951, -5.5370988845825195, -0.0422348827123642, -0.6443802714347839, 0.02074112743139267, 0.5398674011230469]",[7.207118511199951],1,7.207118511199951,7.207118511199951,7.207118511199951,7.207118511199951,6

The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume. As I say, limiting the volume, you still have 700,000 pages of relevant documents. To the extent that somebody wants to look at hundreds of thousands more pages of what the search terms defined by the Congress would be termed irrelevant, at some point we are happy to provide those. We will provide those in the orderly course.    But I will tell you that our experience is it is going to be an overwhelming volume of materials. They will take us some significant time to redact taxpayer information, a significant part of which will have nothing to do with this investigation. But if that is the way the committee wants to go, we will go that way. But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents. Therefore, they suggested with us and selected with us search terms of what would be relevant: Tea Party, examinations, whatever else they picked. There are a whole series of those terms designed to limit the volume of materials.    We still have provided a lot of duplicative and probably irrelevant materials within those search terms, but we have not determined anything within those search terms. We have said if those are the terms that will help you winnow it down, we are happy to work with you. But if the committee wants to get simply large volumes of personal emails from a lot of different people, we will go through again, making sure that we redact those appropriately. As I say, we have provided unredacted copies of all of this in terms of the relevance determined by the committees to the other committees, and we provided all of the redacted information available now and we are continue to redact it.

I know that can't be the case, particularly when some of us have broken ranks, for example, offering and asking for a subpoena with respect to child separation policies.    But to suggest that we're somehow dishonest by saying you're seeking to find one honest man because we believe that this is a charade and a waste of the time of the American people, I think that that is a questionable direction to go.

And, in considering the matter, there was no connection, there was no need for recusal or an independent prosecutor.","Thank you, General Lynch.    We'll now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.    Before being confirmed as Attorney General in May of last year, you were first nominated by President Obama to serve as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and you were originally appointed to the U.S. Attorney post in 1999 by former President Bill Clinton.    The existence of Secretary Clinton's private email server was first brought to light in March of last year, 1 month before your confirmation as Attorney General. A few months after your confirmation, the inspectors general of State and National Intelligence requested the Department of Justice investigate whether classified information was stored on her private email servers. The FBI then opened an investigation into the matter.

What we have been trying to do is all of those people, you have emails from those people with regard to the determination process pursuant to the search terms that we have been working with. The subpoena now says we would like them all for anything. We have now finally completed, although we are still working on the redaction, all of the production of documents regarding the determination process, which is what the IG report focused on. We have said that that is the first priority we have had. We have never said we are not going to provide you the rest of the documents, and in fact, trying to figure out the most efficient way to do it, we have said we will provide you Lois Lerner emails on everything with regard to examinations, appeals, and the regulatory process as it goes forward.    And I have said when we are done with all of that, if you want to actually get emails, if you want them all, we will give them all to you, but if you want to actually take a more focused investigation on the regulatory process or otherwise, we are happy to work with you to figure how that goes. But in light of this chairman's view, as soon as we can finish the rest of these redactions and go forward, we will provide you volumes of emails, which many of them are going to be irrelevant, which is what I said in Congressman Mica's comment. Not that the materials you have are irrelevant; the ones you are likely to get in volume are irrelevant. And if you want it without any selective process, we will redact them. There are going to be thousands of pages and we are happy to provide them to you, but it is not going to expedite the conclusion of this investigation and, as I say, a significant part of it is going to be irrelevant.","He just said something, Mr. Chairman, and I want to make sure it is clear.

The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair. That, in and of itself, will go a long way toward restoring faith and trust in the overall criminal justice system, which is also a problem often raised to my attention during my travels.    So the Department looks forward to continuing to support those important efforts.","Thank you for your response.

11525545003,100000,"It is wise, obviously. Sometimes, I guess, the saying we have in Georgia, ``When the mule is out the gate, it is too late to close the gate.'' You don't get that opportunity after an outbreak has occurred. You all are wise in considering a vaccine bank, whether it is foot-and-mouth disease, whether it is High-Path Avian Influenza.    I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Secretary, I want to let you know, and I think you know this, that I very strongly support the Chairman and the cotton industry, and finding a fix for them, and so whatever you can do to help, I will be there to help as well.    The Rural Development issue has caused some consternation here and there, but I take you at your word that you are going to continue to make that a priority, you are the Secretary, you decide how the Department should be run. And the only thing I would say is we are going to watch to make sure that Rural Development gets the same kind of emphasis that it always has. And you have said that, and I expect that will happen.    And another issue that I hope you and Secretary Ross, and I think you will, keep the Mexicans' feet to the fire on the sugar issue and try to get that resolved. So far you have been doing a great job with that.    One of the things that I went through here recently, we had a High-Path AI outbreak in my district, and the Department did a great job responding to it, and the state and everybody. I have had a firsthand look at this, and it is clear that the time to start a conversation with our trade partners regarding the use of vaccines to minimize the impact of High-Path AI doesn't need to happen during the course of the outbreak. It seems like what we do, but it needs to happen at a different time. That is when the trade impacts are the most damaging.

Let me, if I can, just take people back to the history of this, and to you, Commissioner. This targeting began sometime in March or April of 2010. In June of 2010, Chairman Issa alerted IRS and it made an inquiry. In February of 2011, Lois Lerner sent an email to IRS employees stating that the Tea Party is a very dangerous matter.    Then the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction, in June of 2011, June 3rd, Dave Camp, who you spent time with recently, sent a letter to IRS the heat--it looks like the heat really started to come on at that point.    Now, an entire administration and one of the biggest scandals in government was back during Watergate when, what, 18 minutes of tape was lost.

The other thing I will say is that Mandiant, the cybersecurity forensic experts, recommended that we really prepare ourselves for significant increase, cyber attacks, when you went live with an announcement.    So between the 24th and the 7th, a lot of energy was spent securing wherever we could secure our facilities to give us the best protection against cyber attacks.

11636001109,100000,"Congressman, I appreciate that question, and I know how Ohio has been dramatically affected by the opioid crisis. We have done a lot at the Department of Justice, and I would like to partner with this committee and I am sure General Barr would as well to combat and have additional tools to combat this opioid crisis. But some of the things that we have done is we set up in 2017 the Opioid Fraud and Detection Unit, which was a way that the Justice Department could utilize data to help combat the devastating opioid crisis. We did the largest healthcare fraud takedown in June of 2018. We set up the PIL Task Force, otherwise known as the Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force, in February of 2018. We set up a really innovative way called Operation SOS, which was Synthetic Opioid Surge. General Sessions and I went down to Tampa, Florida, where we saw Manatee County had taken an AUSA and embedded them once a week into the sheriff's office in order to take every fentanyl overdose case, and they dramatically reduced the number of overdose deaths in Manatee County. And we decided to take that model and apply it to the most affected States and districts that could really make a dramatic difference in saving lives.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Acting Attorney General, as you mentioned earlier, there are other important matters within the purview of the Justice Department and within the oversight responsibilities of this committee besides fishing expeditions, trying to get the goods on this President in an apparent effort to impeach him. For example, 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. I am old enough to remember back in the mid '80s when President Ronald Reagan and his wife felt so compelled to do something about the scourge of drugs in this country that the effort to just say no began and other efforts following that, and that was because back at that time, we had 10,000 deaths a year due to drug overdoses, and we now have over 70,000 deaths. So it is gotten, unfortunately, over time worse, not better.

11530956102,100000,"Yes, Congressman. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify that.    So one of the questions is, what information do we track and why about people who are not signed into Facebook? We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. For security, it is to make sure that people who are not signed into Facebook can't scrape people's public information.    You can--even when you are not signed in, you can look up the information that people have chosen to make public on their page because they wanted to share it with everyone, so there is no reason why you should have to be logged in.    But, nonetheless, we don't want someone to be able to go through and download every single public piece of information. Even if someone chose to make it public, that doesn't mean that it is good to allow someone to aggregate it. So, even if someone isn't logged in, we track certain information, like how many pages they are accessing, as a security measure.    The second thing that we do is we provide an ad network that third-party websites and apps can run in order to help them make money. And those ads, similar to what Google does and what the rest of the industry does, it is not limited to people who are just on Facebook. So, for the purposes of that, we may also collect information to make it so that those ads are more relevant and work better on those websites.    There is a control that for that second class of information or an ad targeting anyone can turn off, has complete control over it. For obvious reasons, we do not allow people to turn off the measurement that we do around security.","Clarify and have more confidence.

We have Wells Fargo before me, but I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience. Your colleagues should at least come forward with some assurance.

When I graduated from veterinary school in 1971, I had volunteered for an assignment in the United States Air Force. I don't know that I realized that that would be a food safety and public health mission there. When I served in Ohio it was food safety and public health, and I learned a broad perspective of how important that was. The food safety industry and profession had not matured at that time in the 1970s, but I learned a lot about it, was trained in that area.    We have great veterinarians in our inspection services all over. And while you are correct, your veterinary school in Pennsylvania is one of the renowned ones, along with Iowa State, Kansas, and others, along with my alma mater, University of Georgia, have done a great job putting out professionals who are part of that food safety network. We have also got great career professionals in USDA under the guidance of veterinarians who are doing great work in that.

11497630027,100000,"Mr. Congressman, our discussion about civil rights and the appropriate use of force and all police tactics can only serve to make all of us, the community members and police officers, safer.    In my discussions with police officers around the country, I have found a positive engagement on these issues. I have found them to have some of the best thoughts and best practices to share with other departments on these issues--issues like the best practices for deescalation of certain situations, issues like the best practices for maintaining a relationship with community organizations and citizens councils, issues on police safety. They've provided us valuable input in our program, such as providing bulletproof vests, body-worn cameras. They are focusing on the best ways to use these new technologies.    So, while certainly there may be anecdotal evidence there, as all have noted, there's no data to support it. And what I have seen in my travels across this country is the dedication, the commitment, and the resolve of our brave men and women in law enforcement to improving policing, to embracing the 21st-Century Task Force recommendations, and to continuing to have a dialogue that makes our country safer for all.","Thank you.

All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.

11525545029,100000,"I would be happy to, Congressman. Again, what we see, I agree with you, I think an insurance program for our producers is a much more palatable safety net program from the public shareholder perspective than direct payments were. I thought you all made a lot of progress in 2014 in transitioning to that area of ARC, PLC, backed up with crop insurance, which put some responsibility on the producers themselves.    Now, that insurance program is not perfect, we have some things we need to readjust. There is, on cotton, for instance, the Chairman is interested in, we have a quality issue that the quality degradation is not right. We hope to adjust that.    The other thing that your producers may have, if they are on ARC, may have a county payment in one county, or might farm in both counties, and it is different and they don't quite understand those differences either as well. There is some fine tuning. Overall, the insurance program has been a great addition. We need to look at more specialty crops, how we can cover more specialty crops in that area and more. We don't want to create a program where our producers are farming for the program, and that happened in the past, and that creates some unnatural market forces that we don't want to have happen. We want a true safety net for those who are doing right, and we don't want people farming for insurance payments either, we want them farming legitimately. But the insurance ought to be utilized when there is a true revenue loss to that producer, be it be price, or be it be production, and how can we design that program.    You all had a great start, and we will look forward to working with you all as we go through the 2014 Farm Bill to make sure that the RMA program is even more effective, going forward. We know that the STAX program was not as helpful to the cotton producers as you all would have hoped, and the dairy program, certainly on some of those issues----","Yes, I hope so too. You might not remember, but about 3 years ago I was asked to make some remarks, it was the National Council of Farmer Co-ops in Hilton Head, and I remember this, after I had made my remarks you came up and introduced yourself and we had a nice little chat. And that is my only interaction so far I have had with you, and it was a good memory so I appreciate that.    I want to mention a couple of things: I want to also thank you for re-evaluating the School Lunch Program, bring some commonsense to that, and I wish somebody, and maybe it will be you, not only talk about the nutrition aspects but let's talk about exercise and activity. School-age kids can burn a lot of calories, and I don't think they are getting the activity and exercise like we used to when we were kids. It is good that we are putting, I guess we only have two percent milk, it is one percent or skim milk in the schools, and just some common sense and reasonableness. And I know my dairy producers will appreciate that in Ohio, we are a big dairy state.    Also I want to thank you too, on the regulatory side the Waters of the United States, some common sense in there, and working with Administrator Pruitt and the EPA to go back to the states, and work on a rule that addresses the Supreme Court decisions.    Also I want to ask a question, first of all, on the crop insurance. Do you have any thoughts how we can make crop insurance better and make it a more essential part of the safety net program, because as a policymaker, when I talk to non-farming public, you talk crop insurance the non-farming public can understand that better. And I would argue in a 10 year budget window, it probably isn't that much cost to the taxpayers, but it really helps in the years when we have a disaster, like a widespread drought.

Do you want to share it publicly to broadcast it out to everyone? Do you want to share it with your friends, a specific group of people? Do you want to message it to just one person or a couple of people? That is the most important thing that we do, and I think that in the product that is quite clear.    I do think that we can do a better job of explaining how advertising works. There is a common misperception, as you say, that is just reported--often keeps on being reported--that for some reason we sell data.    I can't be clearer on this topic: We don't sell data.

11525545000,100000,"Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.","Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.    The chair reminds Members they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the order of arrival, and I appreciate Members' understanding.    And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Secretary, again, thanks for being here, and we are looking forward to working with you across the myriad of issues that we have, going forward. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I represent a lot of cotton farmers. I believe we had a very elegant fix to the issue with respect to cotton, to the STAX program, that didn't work. It should have been in the omnibus bill, but our colleagues, particularly two of them in the Senate, refused to see the wisdom of that, and for their own purposes and own benefit, didn't let that happen. Now we are left with the same wreck in cotton. I hope I can count on working with you across whatever tools that we have. Obviously, we think that cottonseed could go under the title I program, and although there could be a lot of challenges with making that happen, we would look forward to working with you either on that or other issues with respect to getting some help to offset what China and India have done to the market, that will allow our producers to compete properly.    I would like to turn now to the Trade Under Secretary that you have announced. Obviously, as authorizers of the 2014 Farm Bill, we thank you very much for seeing the wisdom of that. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you see your Under Secretary working with the other array of trade entities, whether it is the USTR, Department of Commerce, whoever that might be, and the role that that Under Secretary would play, not only in making sure the negotiations go the correct way, but also making sure that the Administration keeps a close eye on enforcement of the various trade things that we have out there.

11497630008,1000,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.    With regard to the Department of Justice enforcement of the gun laws, we take those gun laws very seriously and are committed to using the full panoply of laws and regulations on the books.    We typically use those laws at the Federal level in conjunction with our many and numerous violent crime initiatives. For example, in my former position as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, many of our gang cases also carried with them firearms charges. They would not necessarily be the lead charge, they may not be reflected in the data that you have, but they certainly are an important tool in every prosecutor's arsenal in combating violent crime.    In the discussions----","Well, I think we'll be vulnerable, too, when it comes to people from Syria, when we can't get access to those databases because the country is in disarray, and we can't even gather information, fresh, new, because we can't access the people that we could talk to.    Let me move on to another topic. The latest available data from the Justice Department shows that, during fiscal year 2015, the government reported 6,002 new weapons convictions. This number is down 5.8 percent from the previous fiscal year, when the number of convictions totaled 6,373. Compared to 5 years ago, when there were 7,101 weapons convictions, the number for fiscal year 2015 is down 15.5 percent. Convictions over the past year are lower than they were 10 years ago. Overall, the data show that convictions of this type, weapons violations, are down 34.8 percent from the level of 9,206 reported in 2005.    The President has repeatedly called for new gun control laws, yet your department has seen weapons prosecutions and convictions fall to levels not seen in over a decade.    How do you explain such a precipitous drop in weapon prosecutions and convictions under this Administration? And why is such little emphasis placed on these types of prosecutions, when the President has called for yet more laws when the current laws are not being enforced?","And why is such little emphasis placed on these types of prosecutions, when the President has called for yet more laws when the current laws are not being enforced?","('negative', 'negative', 'negative', 'neutral')","('somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'neutral')","('worker_40', 'worker_62', 'worker_30', 'worker_3')","('neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'neutral')",3, Virginia  Chairman, Attorney General  United States Department of Justice,0 -1 -1 0,Republican,-2 -2 -2 0,1 2 0 0,-1 -1 -1 0,Mr. Goodlatte,0 1 0 1 0 0 0,0 0 0 2 1 1 0,3 1 0,1 1 0,0 2 2,1 1 0 0,0 1 1,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000000,4,"How do you explain such a precipitous drop in weapon prosecutions and convictions under this Administration?

11426003105,100000,"At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.

11420722064,100000,"Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.    And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","('somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'somewhatPositive', 'neutral', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'veryNegative')","('neutral', 'somewhatNegative', 'somewhatNegative', 'neutral', 'somewhatPositive', 'positive', 'neutral')","('worker_51', 'worker_1', 'worker_41', 'worker_0', 'worker_20', 'worker_62', 'worker_30')","('neutral', 'attack', 'neutral', 'attack', 'attack', 'neutral', 'favor')",4, California, Attorney General  United States Department of Justice,0 -1 0 -1 -1 0 1,Democratic,1 1 1 0 0 1 -3,0 -1 -1 0 1 2 0,1 1 1 0 0 1 -1,Ms. Lofgren,1 0 0 1 1 0 0,0 0 2 3 1 1 0,1 2 4,1 1 1,2 3 2,0 -1 -1 0 1 1 0,1 1 1,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000000,4,"And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?",0,100000000000000000000000000,"This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.

And I'm incredibly proud to say that the Department of Justice has already begun the type of outreach that I was discussing at that particular event.    Through our COPS Office, in particular, the Community-Oriented Policing Service Office, we reach out directly to police departments across the country and offer technical assistance, we offer training, we offer peer-to-peer support.    We have found that an incredibly effective way to share information within the law enforcement community is peer-to-peer, police-officer-to-police-officer, chief-to-chief. And so we work with the departments that have, in fact, made great strides in the area of police-community relations and seek to match them up with other departments who are having challenges in this area and who would be receptive to their input.    I also, as I noted in my opening statement, have been on a six-city community policing tour. And as I talk with residents, with young people, elected leaders, I also talk with police officers. I do meet with chiefs and supervisors, but I also talk to the rank-and-file, the officers who are on the beats of our cities, to get their ideas as to what has worked in their city, as to why a positive relationship has developed in the cities where they have had challenges and where they have had struggles.    I have listened to their stories of commitment and dedication and to their embrace of community policing and concern for residents as a program and policy that makes policing more efficient and that makes communities safer. And I'm incredibly proud to support those efforts.","Thank you very much, Chairman Goodlatte.

I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy. If there is anything we can do, I commit to being a serious advocate for American agriculture. The logistics part is part of that, and the waterways are right at the front of that.","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Perdue, thank you for joining us today.
