11635589127	001000	Look, I am proud of what this Administration has done in Iraq. I think we have been prepared to do things, take risks, act against Iran, the true malign actor inside of Iraq today, in ways the previous Administration just had no interest in whatsoever. So, I am very proud of the work we have done there.    I have traveled now to Baghdad as the Secretary. I had been there before in my previous role. I have senior officials on the ground. I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign. I think that is your goal. It is certainly mine.	And we have. And you are the Secretary of State before us. And as a former Member of this body, you also understand the constitutional obligation we have to provide oversight of the Administration.    The Fiscal Year foreign affairs budget eliminates all economic assistance to the Syrian people and all security assistance, known as foreign military financing. That is to Iraq. Since the re-emergence of ISIS, Iraq used FMF to fund urgent counterterrorism requirements, and the State Department claimed those funds were critical to Iraq's efforts to defeat ISIS and improve the security environment in Iraq.    Given these statements by the State Department, why the decision to cut FMF when it seems, based on those statements, that it would undermine efforts in Iraq, our efforts in Iraq, and create the conditions that would allow ISIS to revive?

11393834105	101000	This is a matter, obviously, we would like to know about the loss of the emails.	Yes. Where she explained to the whole world that the IRS was caught with their hand in the cookie jar and they, in fact, were targeting conservative groups. That is why the followup didn't occur. So 2 days before, 2 days before the very lawyer who met with Lois Lerner in 2010 got the data base in the format they wanted, 2 days before--jump ahead 3 years later. Two days before Ms. Lerner goes public, he was meeting with Ms. Lerner again and saying followup will take place.    But the followup doesn't take place because Ms. Lerner goes public and says, you know what--targeting did, in fact, happen. She tried to put the planted question in a bar association speech, spin this in a way that blames good public servants in Cincinnati, which you know is false. And we are--and Mr. Cummings says that is no big deal that you had all this information--give me a break.    One last question I have, right, before I go to the next member. So John Koskinen told this committee just a week ago that he knew in April of this year that a substantial portion of Lois Lerner's emails were lost, and he waited 2 months to tell us. And he waited even longer to tell you. If a private citizen does something like that, under investigation, finds out they have lost important documents and doesn't tell someone, that is a problem.    So is--is it a big deal to you, Mr. Cole, and a big deal to the Justice Department that the head of the Internal Revenue Service waited 2 months to tell the U.S. Congress, 2 months to tell the American people and, most importantly, 2 months to tell the FBI and the Justice Department that they had lost Lois Lerner's emails?

11531349037	001100	Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. You are right that every quarter each participant in the FOMC submits a projection of what they feel is going to happen in the economy and also their projection for appropriate monetary policy. At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018.    Now, we will submit another projection, all of us, in 3 weeks. But since then, what we have seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy. We have seen continuing strength in the labor market. We have seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target.    We have also seen continued strength around the globe. We have seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate pass as we go into the March meeting, and I wouldn't want to prejudge that.	Thank you.    Chairman Powell, the Fed's median projection is for three interest rate increases in 2018. What would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year?

11531349079	000011	We have particular responsibilities, maximum employment, stable prices. We don't have estimates of that kind of thing. There are many other estimates out there, but honestly we don't have a Fed estimate for what that number would be.	Now, let me ask this question, and I would like to follow up with you on this matter particularly.    But let me ask you this when we just talk about these tax cuts. How much of corporate tax savings do you think will actually go toward wages, as opposed to stock buybacks, capital investments, and mergers?    I say this because I want to just let you know, even before you answer, Morgan Stanley announced it is estimated that 43 percent of corporate tax savings will go to buybacks and dividends, which enriches just the top 1 percent of those major investors; 19 percent would go toward mergers and acquisitions; 17 percent would go toward investments; and only the crumbs, 13 percent, would go to one-time bonuses and scant raises.    In fact, there are nine pharmaceutical companies that have already announced over $50 billion in buybacks since the tax law was passed. How much of these taxes will go into salaries and wages?

11635589072	100001	Yes, let me try to address that. You referenced the report that the State Department did. It was amazing work by some really talented State Department officers to go out and collect that data. I think the data speaks for itself in terms of the horrific nature of what took place there.    With respect to making this legal determination, I am not prepared to provide you an answer today. Know that we are still looking at it, frankly, that I am still looking at that more specifically. My objective here is to get a really good outcome, to change this behavior, then to hold those responsible accountable. I want to make sure that we do this in a thoughtful way. I get the messaging that takes place when a Secretary of State makes these designations. I value that and it is important. But I think we would all agree the most important thing we can do is get both accountability and behavioral change, and that is what the State Department is working to do. We are still actively considering how to approach those conclusions.	Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate that.    I would like to move on at this point to Burma. A year and a half ago, the Burmese military drove the Rohingya out of the Rakhine State through a campaign of killings and rapes and burning of villages, and some of the most horrific and unspeakable crimes that we had seen on this globe in a long, long time. We all appreciated when then-Secretary Tillerson, your predecessor, dubbed these atrocities as ethnic cleansing. Now, as you know, ethnic cleansing is a powerful message, but it does not have legal weight.    And since 2017, overwhelming evidence has come out that clearly shows that the Burmese military committed crimes against humanity. Even the Department's own investigation into these atrocities came to similar conclusions. Several entities, including the House, have concluded that these crimes constitute genocide. The State Department has not made any legal pronouncement at this point beyond ethnic cleansing.    Given all the evidence available to you, could you comment today if you are ready to conclude or where you are in determining whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military did constitute at least crimes against humanity?

11531349132	101000	I would be glad to, sir. First of all, racial discrimination in mortgage lending, in any kind of lending, is completely unacceptable. Wherever we have authority we will use it to stop that from happening and punish it when it does happen.    We have some authority here. The CFPB has quite a lot of authority in this area as well, but where we have it for the banks that we supervise, we supervise carefully and aggressively to try to find these problems and address them.	Along those lines, I want to pick up where Mr. Meeks and Mr. Capuano questioned you. I have shared with your staff a recent article from my hometown newspaper about black home buyers continuing to be denied conventional mortgage loans at a much higher rate than whites, even when controlling for income, loan amount, and neighborhood.    In the St. Louis metropolitan area, African Americans who applied for conventional mortgages are two and a half times more likely to be denied than non-Hispanic whites. That is according to 2 years of recent HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) data.    Where there is loan activity houses have a chance to sell. Where houses sell, people move in. Where people move in, restaurants, community centers, and grocery stores are built. None or very little of that is happening in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods in St. Louis or elsewhere in this country.

11531349014	100100	Our current framework says that the committee would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation above or below 2 percent. We understand that inflation is going to be buffeted by various factors, and that it may not be exactly at 2 percent. It will be above; it will be below. We see it as a symmetric objective.    I would say that framework is working. The market understands it. We have been trying to get up to 2 percent. But generally speaking, inflation has been low and stable for 15 or 20 years now.	My time is starting to wind down. I would like to explore inflation targeting. In your testimony, it appears the Fed is keeping to their 2 percent inflation target. I am still trying to--I struggle with how this is commensurate with a statutory mandate for achieving price stability.    But I also saw from the FOMC minutes, the most recent minutes, that there was at least discussion about moving from the 2 percent target to a target range. At least 2 percent is a linear function. A range, obviously, is not.    I am really struggling with how is this commensurate with price stability? Some commentators are calling for a 3 percent, 4 percent target.    Two questions, number one, do we have an expectation the Fed will move from its 2 percent target? At some point, at 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent inflation targeting, have you violated your price-stability mandate?

11531349140	100000	Thank you, Mr. Lucas. What we are doing right now is we are taking a careful look at the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. I think our view is that the leverage ratio is a very important requirement for banks, but it should be a backstop. It should be a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital.    I think that the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio that we put into place in, I guess 2013 in that range, went a little too far. It unfortunately seems to be deterring some low-risk wholesale-type activities that we really want financial institutions to engage in. One of those is client clearing, and particularly not counting margin.    But I think our way of addressing that is going to be, I think, to lower the calibration of the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio. That does seem to get done what needs doing there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, I thank you for being here. Before I ask a general question and a broader question, I do note that I think you are my fourth Chairman to be able to visit within this environment since I have been a member of this committee.    I would like to discuss an issue with you today that you and I have already discussed. My good colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Luetkemeyer has a bill regarding, and that is the supplemental leverage ratio clearing margin.    I know that Blaine's bill has strong bipartisan support from members of this committee and the Ag Committee. In essence, it would offset those margin amounts for purposes of SLR because margin is inherently a risk management tool and legally must be kept separate from a bank's own funds.    The Fed can effect this change without legislation, however, and your predecessor showed a willingness to look at the issue.

11531349006	110000	No, sir. Our intention over the long term is that the balance sheet would be no larger than it needs to be to implement monetary policy, and that it would consist primarily of treasury securities.    We purchased the mortgage-backed securities in the aftermath of the crisis. That was an unusual practice, and it was something that we did in unusual circumstances. Those will run off over time, and I don't expect that we would use that tool again, other than in a very severe situation.	OK. As I understand it, though, I have not been able to see on the public record the expectation with respect to the composition of the balance sheet. I believe that currently you are carrying $2.4 trillion of treasuries, $1.8 trillion of mortgage-backed securities. Is our expectation--that is roughly back of the envelope, one-third, two-thirds ratio. Is it your intention to keep that same ratio of mortgage-backed securities?    Again, many of us are concerned about the possibility of the Fed involved in credit allocation decisions. Because right now, I don't really see a glide path to a treasuries-only balance sheet.

And we have got a great ally in Colombia, and Colombia is doing the right thing by taking care of these folks who are in crises.    It just seems to me that it is in contrast to the position that we are taking on our southern border, because I do not hear any talks--I am now speaking to the members of the Colombian government--they are not saying they are being invaded. They have got millions of people crossing their border every day. They are not saying they are being invaded. There is no talk about building a wall. But, rather, they are calling for a coordination of humanitarian assistance and working within their group.    The fact of the matter is, in talking to some of the Colombian members of their government, I was talking to them not too long ago, yesterday to be a fact, they expect the possibility of a bigger crisis. They say 2-3 million people may be coming across. But they were going to try to make sure they take care of them, not prevent them from coming across.    A stark contrast to the policies that we have on our southern border. Do you see a difference from people trying to flee for their life and safety on the southern border of the United States and the border between Venezuela and Colombia?

11532380114	001010	I would think that those matters are worthy of consideration. But as to the details of them and for me to express an ultimate comment today, I'm unable to so.	Great. Thank you very much.    I'm not and never was a prosecutor, but I did some criminal defense work back in the day when I practiced law for almost 20 years. It seems to me that a Presidential campaign using a law firm as a conduit to pay for activities with which the campaign itself doesn't want to be directly associated is more than just dirty politics; it's also, quite possibly, illegal. To me, it seems that this is at least a violation of campaign finance laws for failure to accurately disclose the actual recipients of campaign disbursements.    However, this type of arrangement is not illegal--if it's not illegal under current law, I fear that we're risking opening Pandora's box with all sorts of underhanded activities by campaigns being laundered through law firms and shielded under attorney-client privilege.    As the chief law enforcement official in this country, do you share similar concerns? And, in your opinion, is it legal under current law for a Presidential campaign to hide its funding of the compilation and dissemination of political dirt on its opponent by using a law firm to directly pay for the work?

11635589010	100000	So, I am of the nature that I try not to contemplate failure too often, but we have certainly considered what the risks are associated with the efforts that we have provided to date and the efforts. Frankly, you mentioned the Lima Group, all the countries in the region now, some 50-some that have recognized the proper leader, as designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.    Look, we have seen Russia continue trying to exert influence. We know that the Cubans are providing substantial support to the Maduro regime. Allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome continued destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. It will certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos, the economic, and refugees flowing from those regions, from Venezuela to the region as well. So, there is lots of downside if the Venezuelan people's objective is not achieved.    Second, the day and week after is going to be a long process. The Maduro regime's destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months. This is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that is going to cost, I have seen estimates between $6 and $12 billion, and years to repair. So, the day after means making sure the Cuban and Russian influence are out; Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy. And the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them through this transition period.    The United States will certainly be part of it, but I am confident we will find the coalition that we have built, some 50 countries strong, that our State Department has built, will be part of that as well.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Let me first say, Mr. Secretary, that the chairman and I will be working in a bipartisan fashion to plus-up your budget. I think we need stability throughout the globe, and we look forward to working with you on that issue.    Tomorrow, the chairman and I will be traveling to the Venezuelan border in Colombia. And I have kind of a two-part question. First is I do not think failure is an option here, but what would be the consequences for the United States and the region if Maduro succeeds in Venezuela? And the second part is, if Maduro does not succeed, what would a post-Maduro reconstruction strategy look like?

11531349029	100000	I do think this is a time when we need to be alert to buildup of either financial imbalances or to inflation building up. We don't really see those right now. I think I also said that in my 2015 speech.    But if you look at the financial stability situation broadly, we do see some high asset prices. What we don't see is the buildup of leverage among households. We see the banking system and the financial system generally as being very resilient. I think the financial stability picture shows at most modest risks.	Clearly the wave of bonuses and raises and the announcements certainly suggest that there is upward pressure on wages as a result of these tax cuts.    In a 2015 speech, you expressed concern that quantitative easing and unconventional monetary accommodation could fuel dangerous risk-taking.

11531349053	100000	I do. I think cybersecurity overall is one of the really significant threats and we can never feel like we have done enough to deal with it. We have tried to harmonize through the FFIEC process, our supervisory guidance on what we expect from firms on cybersecurity issues and data safety and that kind of thing. I am sure we can do a better job, and we are committed to trying.	I look forward to working with you on that, because I told the bankers when I left them, if you see a problem, let me know, because I have a chance to talk to Mr. Powell myself here this morning, so we will carry the message. Thank you for that.    With regards to data security and cybersecurity, this is an issue that we are working on right now. My committee, my subcommittee, has a bill that we are putting together. Data security, cybersecurity threats have the potential to wreck our economy, to wreak havoc with it. We subject financial companies to an absurd maze of cybersecurity regulations.    The Federal Reserve is one of the many entities that examines for cybersecurity. There is zero harmonization between the agencies. The result is that financial firms spend thousands of hours complying with regulations, rather than actually protecting their systems and their customers. Do you see this as a problem?

11531349109	101000	Let me say that the situation with LIBOR is such that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in London has said that they will no longer compel banks to submit their submissions to the LIBOR panel after the end of 4 years.    At that time, the FCA can no longer guarantee the continuation of LIBOR. Now if LIBOR were to stop being published then, there are $300 plus trillion worth of LIBOR-based contracts in the world. That has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem.    Solving it is very high priority for us and I think for financial regulators around the world. There will be costs to doing so, but they would be trivial in comparison to the failure to be ready for this change, should it be necessary.	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Chairman Powell for coming before the committee, congratulations on your confirmation. We look forward to working with you.    Chairman Powell, it is my understanding that the Fed has been actively involved in developing a potential alternative to LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate), called SOFR--the Secured Overnight Funding Rate.

11531349008	101000	In the case of mortgage-backed securities, the roll off is less predictable. Of course with treasuries, you know when they are going to mature and you can really see what that roll off is going to be. With mortgage-backed securities, roll off will depend on the level of interest rates and the level of people refinancing their mortgages.    As rates go up, refis will go down and you will see slower roll off--	The Monetary Policy Report that came out days ago shows the balance sheet roll off caps. What I am having a little trouble with is, as I look at the charts in the report, Mr. Chairman, you don't seem to have sufficient MBS (mortgage-backed security) redemptions that allow you to reach your $20 billion runoff pace.    As I read the charts, I think the expectation is by the end of the year, we are looking at a $50 billion balance sheet roll off.

11635589139	001100	I am not sure I can do it briefly, but let me try. It is complicated space.	Thank you.    And would you trust Iran with a bone saw? In other words, earlier the question was, would you trust Saudi Arabia with a bone saw; therefore, we cannot give them nuclear weapons or engage with them at all. I think an important point to note is I would not trust Iran with a bone saw. They have quite a few bodies, frankly, on their conscience from Syria, from a lot of places.    And so, I just want to commend you and the Administration for your decision to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. I think that was a smart move. I think it sent a very strong message that it is not just about the development of nuclear weapons over a period of 10 years; it is also about behavior in the region and development of ballistic missiles. So, I just want to commend you on that.    Closer to home--actually, I want to hit Yemen real quick. The very first thing this committee did--and I hate to obsess about it and channelize on it, but it has really stuck with me--the very first thing this committee did, Mr. Secretary, in the new Congress was, basically, to take away the authority of the Administration to be involved in any way with Yemen. And I think most of the members of this committee have never had a classified briefing on what is occurring in Yemen. They have never had a briefing on the SCIF. And I think there is a perception out there that it is the United States and Saudi Arabia that are creating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.    Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?

11531349088	100000	Yes, I will. We think we need the leverage ratio as a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital. We think that the current calibration of the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio is not appropriate. We are looking at a recalibration that would address that exact concern.	I want to move onto another topic, but continuing the discussion on the importance of getting our regulations right to benefit Main Street and rural America.    Minnesota's 6th Congressional District, which I represent, is home to some of the finest and most productive farmers and manufacturers in the world. Many of these same individuals and businesses, who are making such a positive economic impact on my district, are inadvertently harmed by the current formulation of the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) that fails to recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin.    This bank capital rule is increasing clearance costs for farmers and manufacturers, making it more expensive for them to use the cleared derivatives market.    I hope that as you and your colleagues at the Fed review the SLR that you come to the same conclusion that a coalition of Republican and Democrat members on this committee have, that we must recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin in a revised bank capital rule.    Will you commit to working with us and our colleagues on the Ag Committee who want their constituents to have access to affordable and competitive cleared derivatives markets?

11635589012	100000	So, the first thing we did is we identified it, something previous Administrations were loath to do. I get it. We have important economic interests with China. Many American jobs depend on that. President Trump is doing his level best to set the trade relationship so that it is fair and reciprocal. So, I would describe that as the first thing the Administration did.    The second thing is we recognize this is a great power battle and we are engaged in it across the world. It is our support of ASEAN. It is identifying the threat from Chinese State-owned enterprise technology companies, sharing that with countries in the Middle East and in Europe, identifying these risks, so that Western democracies around the world will wake up to the risks and will push back.    And you mentioned One Belt One Road, in particular. We are doing our best to make sure that there are Western competitors every place there is a project that China is putting forth. We are happy to compete. If it is fair, transparent, open transaction, you know, the Chinese may win a few, but I am very confident that American businesses will do incredibly well there.    What we have seen is just the opposite. We have seen transactions that were not straight-up, that were not fair, that were designed with a national security interest, and not an economic interest for the people of their country. The State Department has shared with these countries and their people and their leadership the risks from entering into these. And frankly, I think countries throughout Asia/Southeast Asia are waking up to this concern as well.	And thank you. I think it is an historic opportunity for the region, the hemisphere. I think it will transform Venezuela, which is now a failed State. It was a prosperous nation. Now, 20 years later, it is in utter chaos. And I think it would also impact Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia. It could really transform the Western Hemisphere and be a major foreign policy victory.    On China, as I get my threat briefings, Islamist terror has always been the focus, but it seems to me that China now is becoming more the No. 1 threat in nation States. Can you tell me about the threat from China? In particular, what I am concerned about is the One Belt One Road Initiative. You know, their theft of intellectual property--they are in our medical institutions, our universities. But the One Belt One Road, they are literally overleveraging countries, and particularly in Africa, too, where they can take over these countries without a shot fired. And they are in Sri Lanka now--they have that port--and in Djibouti.    What is the Administration doing to counter the Chinese threat?	What is the Administration doing to counter the Chinese threat?

11531349123	101000	I think we are committed to being as transparent as we possibly can about monetary policy and about regulation. I think, if I remember what it was like back when I was an undersecretary of the Treasury in the 1990's, the Fed didn't even publish a post-meeting statement.    Now you look at the massive number of things we publish, we are much more transparent. I think we can continue on that path. We are never done with that.    In regulation, I think it is very important that we be transparent. In fact, we are working across a broad range of issues there, including, I would point out, stress testing. We have a package of transparency regulations. In general, I think it is appropriate for us to always be working on that, and it is just--	Yes, sir.

11531349039	001100	I would say that my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December. Again, each member of the FOMC is going to be writing down a new set of projections and a new estimate of appropriate monetary policy as we go into the March meeting, which begins 3 weeks from today. So I wouldn't want to prejudge that new set of projections, but we will be taking into account everything that has happened since December.	OK, the last time the Fed released its projections for the pace of interest rate increases was in mid-December. Since then, we have had two major financial events.

11531349027	101000	Thank you, Chairman Barr. It is very hard to trace through the effects of a change in tax policy into things like wage growth in the economy. But let me try.    Lower corporate taxes should lead to higher investment. The effect is not easy to estimate but you would think and the studies find that it should lead to higher investment. Higher investment should lead to higher productivity over time, and higher productivity should lead to higher wages over time.    It is very hard to put your hands on exactly how much that would be, but higher productivity, of course, is very, very welcome, and will be driven by higher investment.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, congratulations again on your confirmation. I appreciate your commitment in our conversations to transparency and your demonstration of that commitment to date to clearly communicate the Fed's monetary policy trajectory.    You have noted on numerous occasions that the remaining slack that may exist in the labor market is at least in part attributable to stagnant wage growth. In your confirmation hearing, a Senator on the Banking Committee cited a 2016 Fed research paper concluding that corporate tax cuts do not translate into higher wages.    But we have seen a wave of corporate announcements of bonuses and raises since the tax cuts were enacted. Specifically over 4 million workers and counting have received over $3 billion in bonuses and raises during the last 8 weeks. The Labor Department recently announced the largest increase in wages since the end of the recession.    Based on these numbers, is the Senator in question, and are the Fed researchers that he cites, are they wrong and have tax cuts in fact helped increase wages as your testimony indicates that wages should be increasing at a faster pace as a result of a more stimulative fiscal policy?

11532380015	000011	Is that a question?	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome again, Mr. Attorney General.    I'd like to begin by putting a few statements by the President up on the screen.    The first, from July 24, 2017: ``So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General], looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?''    The second, from November the 3rd: ``Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and the FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.''    The third, also from November 3rd: ``Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI and Justice Dept.''    I believe he is referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren in that last one. When Richard Nixon spoke about us that way, at least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors.

11635589079	100000	So, you asked three questions there, I believe. The first one was what was my knowledge base. I think at that time I knew most of what had taken place, although I do not recall the exact sequence. I certainly have learned more about that since then. I have learned additional facts since that moment in time.    The second question was did I discuss the murder. The answer is yes. I think I said it that day, that I had discussed the murder with him.    And then, the third question is how will we hold them accountable. You have seen the Trump Administration do just that with respect to 17 individuals. We are continuing all across the government, certainly with overt means and all the tools that we have in our capacity, to learn more facts about this. President Trump has made very clear that we will continue to work to identify those who are responsible for Jamal Khashoggi's murder and hold them accountable. We will. I stand by that today. I am sure President Trump will as well.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome back, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for being here.    Mr. Secretary, I do not want to talk at a political level today with you. I want to talk from the heart. And I want to talk about a matter of justice on behalf of one of my constituents well known to you. I want to show you a picture.    This picture took place on November 19th, 2017 in my district. I am holding a cane because I had had a bad accident at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, a few months before and I still needed a cane to hobble around, not the most flattering picture of me.    Next to me is a man named Jamal Khashoggi. He is a mild-mannered man. He and I are discussing Middle East issues. He was a Saudi citizen, family, children, had on occasion worked for the Saudi government or for members of the royal family. He was mild-mannered, soft-spoken, and a moderate critic of the Kingdom. He wanted to see modernization. He wanted to see reforms. He was a columnist sometimes for The Washington Post, our local newspaper here in Washington.    On October 2d, 2018, 11 months later, my constituent, a legal resident of the United States who lived in Tysons Corner in Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia, was lured into the sovereign territory, the consulate of the Saudi government in Istanbul because he was seeking papers to get remarried. He had his fiancee outside waiting for him. He had been to the consulate before, and they had lulled him into believing he would be safe. But, of course, he was not.    What we know was that, on that day, two planes under the control of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia flew in with two teams whose objective was to either kidnap or kill Mr. Khashoggi. One presumes the objective involved killing because, not a diplomatic tool normally, they brought with them a bone saw. We know all of that because of revelations from Turkey. But those revelations, as I understand it, have been confirmed by our intelligence community; you would know better than I.    Nonetheless, what we do know is the Saudi government lied consistently. They lied about whether he safely left the consulate that day, knowing full well he did not. They lied about his murder. They lied about the conspiracy to murder him. They lied about who did it and how it was done.    And I guess I want to show you another picture, Mr. Secretary. This is a picture that took place 14 days after the murder. And that shows you and the Crown Prince, who many believe orchestrated and ordered the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, my constituent. And I guess what this picture raises is a question. At what point, as Americans, do we insist that the inalienable rights enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, all three of which were denied my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi, when do they trump diplomatic nicety? Is there ever a time when we are going to, as a country, insist, you know what, we are not going to do business as normal and we are going to hold you to account?    Now, at that meeting, you said, I believe, that they would be held to account, but you were meeting with a man who was assuring you they would be held to account, when he is himself suspected strongly of having orchestrated the murder. And so, I guess I want to ask you, Mr. Secretary, were you aware of the fact at that point of the gruesome details of the murder of my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi? Did you discuss that murder with the Crown Prince? And how are we going, moving forward, to hold the Crown Prince and the Saudi government responsible for one of the most grisly episodes ever to occur in a consulate or an embassy in our diplomatic experience?

11635589143	111000	Yes, look, the good news is I am hopeful that Martin Griffiths, the U.N. Special Envoy in Yemen, in the next handful of days will make progress. He may not. We have a great agreement in Stockholm. We have not been able to enforce it. The Houthis have refused to withdraw from the Port of Hodeidah. I hope that they will in the coming days. Frankly, if I were betting, I would probably bet against, but one lives in hope.    Congress obviously has its own independent right to act as it so chooses. It has its constitutional authorities. I can say this: I hope everyone who cares about the people of Yemen understand that the legislation that passed did not remotely benefit them. Indeed, it will work to their detriment.

I am concerned that it is going to go from Venezuela to Nicaragua. I mean, Nicaragua last year bought $80 million worth of tanks from Russia.

This idea that somehow they are having this dialogue now, they keep walking away from this dialogue with the opposition.

America will once again, this Administration will once again reaffirm our commitment to our NATO allies, and we will again ask them, because it is important, to do their share to make sure that NATO is around for the next 70 years.	Well, can I, because my time is out, I just want to say this: that the President said--again, the NATO officials we met with, they are great allies, they remain great allies, but there were some comments that were made, Article 5 concerns. And that came up at yesterday's hearing, too. And the President said ``Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people. . . . They are very aggressive people.

You would be hard-pressed to find in the Congressional Record or any testimony from members of the Federal Reserve at the time Congress granted this power that it would be used to supplant open market operations of the FOMC. I trust we will be having further discussions about that.

11531349059	001100	Thank you. Of course when we are setting monetary policy we are focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment. In doing that, we consider many, many factors all around, the global economy, et cetera.    Fiscal policy changes can have an effect, and changes of this size can have an effect. That can be seen, of course, in the path to policy. It is very hard to say in advance what that would be, but the answer to your question is generally we take all those things into account.	Chairman Powell, welcome. As the Chair of our committee points out, you are required to be independent and accountable. You are also required to be tall and short.    Your opening statement mentions great exports. But you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by $60 billion in the last year. I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit. That is why the country elected Donald Trump President.    Now, the Chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017. He is right. We had Obama's fiscal policies, Obama's tax policies, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, Janet Yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet, and we had a great year.    As a matter of fact, we have been on a roll since 2011. We were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we would have a labor shortage and higher wages. We were going well, and so instead of continuing to be on a roll, we have abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy, throwing away the budget caps, $1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill.    But I think that we will still do well because our scientists, our entrepreneurs, and our workers are the best in the world, and they will make up for all the mistakes we are making here in Washington.    I see behind you, sir, the green shirts that call for full employment. It is not enough to go with the economists' definition of full employment, say 4 percent. We need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor.    That is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for 2 percent, but 2-1/2 percent inflation. That is the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now.    Now, when we talk about some workers getting a $1,000 bonus, yes, a few have, but a family of five's share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000. What greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country than that some charlatan can say, ``Here is the deal. I will give you $1,000. It is money in your pocket, and we will just slap a $26,000 mortgage on your future.''    Now, Chairman Powell, in your confirmation hearings, you said that, I believe, that no bank is any longer too big to fail. I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail; they would pull the entire economy down. We had to bail them out with $700 billion.    I would point out that the Wall Street prices into the value of the banks' stock, but more importantly, to the value of their unsecured debt, an implicit Federal guarantee, an assumption that they will be bailed out.    I have a number of questions for the record, but I will actually ask one for you to respond to. We have adopted these profligate fiscal policies. Huge tax cuts leading to a massive increase in the deficit number that is right behind you, then we busted the budget caps.

11635589016	100000	Yes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary of State, thank you and welcome.    I want to talk a little bit about the Western Hemisphere and what is going on. I see a bigger plan in what is going on in Venezuela I think than most people. I see a lot of similarities of what happened with Cuba and what is happening in Venezuela. In Cuba, they allowed the people to leave that were disenchanted with the government. In Venezuela, there are 5,000 people leaving every day. They expect, by the end of this year, to be about 5 million people that have left Venezuela, those who are disenchanted with this government.    I really believe that there is a bigger plan here to destabilize the Western Hemisphere with what is going on in Venezuela. You have a million people putting a great deal of pressure on Colombia, and they have opened their doors and they have done a great job in helping these people. You have 700,000 people going into Peru. You have people all the way down to Argentina. Some of these countries cannot absorb the quantity of people that are leaving Venezuela daily. So, to me, I think this is part of a bigger plan to destabilize this whole region.    It continues to keep us busy. It continues to make America the bad apple in all this. And I would hope that we will continue to put pressure on Maduro. I do not believe in military action, but I do believe that sanctions will be effective and working with the Lima Group will be very effective.    This afternoon, I am meeting with Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Guaido. She is very concerned about her husband. She feels that any day now they are going to pick him up, and God knows where they are going to put him.

But you can rest assured that, if we see malfeasance, misbehavior, those doing things that are inappropriate, the team understands their mission set, which is to hold every officer accountable against the mission set that the Constitution and President Trump have laid out for us.	It is my understanding, but if there is something other than that, maybe we will followup afterwards. But it seems to me that this is a circumstance that should be easy. When our construction, our building over there, needs assistance and needs attention, that we should be able to do that, and certainly under the exact same provisions that they are.

It is at the heart of what we are doing at the moment, which is to focus on smaller institutions and, without losing any safety and soundness, try make sure that our regulation is no more burdensome than it needs to be and then work our way up the food chain.	Thank you, Chair Hensarling.    Thank you, Chair Powell, for being here. Good to see you again.    I want to go back to something that I think was touched on when you began your testimony this morning. During your confirmation hearing, you spoke about the importance of tailoring regulations to fit the specific scope and practices of a financial institution.    I think your quote was actually, ``Even as we have worked to implement improvements to the banking system, financial system, we have also sought to tailor regulation and supervision to the size and risk profile of banks, particularly community institutions.''    I just want to make sure that your view on continuing to tailor regulations to the specific institution has remained the same. You are still committed to doing that?

11532380118	110000	Well, many States have capital punishment. The Federal Government has capital punishment for a number of offenses, and it is specifically controlled. We have within the Department a recommendation process through our appointed committee to seek or not seek a death penalty when a case is charged. Sometimes it's a complex thing.    But I believe the death penalty, the Federal death penalty, is a part of our law. I think it's a legitimate penalty. It's constitutional. And we will do our duty, even in those circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty.	Okay. It seems to me that there's always been a tremendous amount of gray area in that whole field, which I think, as a Nation, you know, we need to look much more closely at, both from the State's point of view and the Federal Government point of view. But that's just my feeling on that.    I'm running out of time. I had about four other things, but let me just go to one final thing here.    I've been very involved in the area of victims' rights. I was the--following Henry Hyde's leadership on this, introduced a victims' rights constitutional amendment years back, various pieces of legislation on victims' rights. And I've also worked closely with the parents of murdered children. And when you talk about something that affects one's family, there's nothing that affects a family more adversely than something like that happening.    And we still have capital punishment on the books, both at the Federal level and many of our States. Yet these families are dragged left and right, up and down, back and forth, into hearing after hearing. These cases can drag on for more than 20 years before the imposition of capital punishment actually occurs. And, in many instances, obviously, it never does.    And while these people are behind bars, oftentimes they attack, sometimes kill guards, attack, sometimes kill other inmates.

11393834114	100000	This is still an ongoing investigation, that is correct.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe that in his testimony he actually--the response to why there was a 2-month wait was that he was informed, and then for the next 2 months they were attempting to recover the lost emails from other host computers where those emails were located. So that just because you lose the emails from Ms. Lerner's hard drive, where she was the ``from'' sender, that they would exist in the ``to'' recipients. Computers never--I believe over 80 other host computers where they were looking. So that is part of the delay.    But I would like to know, also, the full extent of what was going on, as well.    Deputy General Cole, as I am sure you are aware the nature of the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS practices regarding the tax-exempt applications has been such a lengthy, lengthy discussion before various congressional committees. Despite unsubstantiated allegations that the Justice Department has prematurely closed its investigation for political reasons, Attorney General Holder has repeatedly confirmed before both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees that the Justice Department and FBI are still actively investigating this matter.    On January 29, 2014, the attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the matter, and I quote: ``is presently being investigated. Into the use of being done, an analysis is being conducted.''    Several months later, in April--on April 8 of 2014--the Attorney General further testified before the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed that the department's investigation was still an ongoing matter that the Justice Department is actively pursuing.

11635589074	101000	So, you have seen real tangible ways we have done in Ukraine, providing defensive items to the Ukrainian people. We have provided intelligence assistance. I saw that in my previous role and before I was the Secretary of State. You have seen our efforts all across the world, Ukraine and Georgia included, to push back against Russian efforts to interfere when elections are approaching, as we are in Ukraine today.    There are many elements. And I was speaking about things mostly that the State Department and the Department of Defense were involved in. There are elements all across the U.S. Government determined to help the Georgian people, who are very pro-American and share our understanding of the way that region ought to operate.

11532380000	110100	Mr. Chairman, as a former Federal prosecutor who emphasized gun prosecutions, I've long believed that they have a significant impact in reducing violent crime. Professors, earlier this year, have explained that they share that view based on scientific analysis. It will be a high priority of ours. You are correct that prosecutions fell.    One instance that was raised during the Texas--terrific, horrible shooting at the church there in Sutherland, Texas, was the ability of an individual to get a firearm and whether or not they filed correctly their form before you get one that--it requires questions about criminal convictions and court marshals.    Those prosecutions, I've noticed, have dropped by over 50 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. I think those are worthy prosecutions. And when a criminal is carrying a gun during a criminal act of some other kind, that is a clear and present danger to the public. And those cases are important, and the impact: reduction of crime.	Well, thank you, General Sessions.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions, and I will begin by recognizing myself.    Under your leadership, the prosecution of firearms offenses have increased 23 percent over the same period of the previous year. Furthermore, the number of defendants charged with using a firearm in violent crimes of drug trafficking rose 10 percent over the previous year.    We have a slide which shows the increase as compared to the Obama-era numbers.

11531349031	100100	Flattening of yield curves in the past has been a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold inflation down.    That is not the situation we have now. It is very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up, as the economy strengthens. I don't see a particularly large--there is always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.	If I could point out a possible risk that is out there and have you react to it that was created by the unconventional monetary policy. Some have blamed the Fed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by producing an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates exceeded long-term rates.    At the beginning of 2011, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was almost 3 percent. But as of February of this year, that same spread has been whittled down to a mere 0.5 percent, and this is a 450 percent drop. Given a flattening yield curve, and economic conditions that you can see, call for raising the Fed funds rate, how will the Fed avoid another inverted yield curve?    Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer-term assets more quickly to counteract that flattening yield curve?

11532380042	101000	Well, we can. And the constitutional rights of Americans should be protected. And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.    I know the committee has decided to put some additional restrictions on the way the act is conducted. We did not think that was lawfully required. Congress can make its own decisions, and we will continue to be able to share our thoughts about how the legislation should be crafted.	Thank you very much.    Welcome, Mr. Attorney General.    We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise? Can't we allow the intelligence community to stop terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans?

11531349113	100000	Yes, I do, I think systemic risk would be decreased by moving to SOFR. LIBOR spreads blew out during the crisis, and I think a risk-free rate, which is really used to price the vast derivative markets and not so much the bank lending markets. It is really much more in a derivatives based now, would be an improvement from a financial stability perspective to have SOFR over LIBOR.	Yes, sir.

11531349103	001000	First, again, I am not at all familiar with either the British bill or the EEOC proposed rule that was--I am not familiar with either of those. These are the things that Congress should consider. We have a job, we have a really important job to do that you have assigned us to do. For now we are going to stick to that and try to achieve--	OK, fair enough. The reason you are not familiar with it is because the Trump Administration stopped it. It was proposed in 2016. Companies were given 2 years to work their way in. But as of last August, the Trump Administration said no, we don't want to know how you pay women, how you pay people of racial groups or ethnicity groups. We don't care about that.    Now, I personally think that is horrendous and I would actually say that, again, if you are interested in an economy that has some degree of equitability you need statistics. You need numbers. Anecdotal answers are very interesting and they make for good political commentary, but they don't help us address the problems.    I would ask therefore if something like that, that is new to Britain, doesn't seem to have impacted Barclays in any particularly bad way, but provides us the information we have to go forward to argue for pay equity across the board.

I appreciate your articulating that. You have also said that raising the ceiling is only the first step. The job that must be attacked is deficit reduction and addressing the cost associated with mandatory spending.    We heard a similar thing from Chairman Greenspan, we heard that from Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Yellen. We are on an unsustainable budget path, are the remarks that Fed Chairmen have traditionally shared with us.

11635589125	101000	Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.    As for what is going to be shared and released on conversations between the President and his foreign partners, the White House ultimately makes those decisions. And so, the inquiries would properly be lodged there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us. Thank you for your service.    March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?

11635589064	001100	So, I think it is important to consider all of these things in the context of the challenges from China. You have seen what we have done with respect to Taiwan. It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, as you know, last Congress I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act, and President Trump signed it into law last March. The intention of this legislation was to allow our high-level officials to go to Taipei and to allow their high-level officials to come here to the United States, including Washington. In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations? And can the people of Taiwan count on you to advocate for further implementation of that I think very important legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act?

11635589098	001001	I will have to look into it.	Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.    In particular, we have seen your Assistant Secretary of State Chris Ford say the Department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of understanding, which do not require congressional oversight or approval, rather than through a one-two-three agreement.    And we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which in normal course are made available to the public, but are, instead, being kept secret, all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.    So, can I count on you and the Administration to release these six--they are called Part 810 authorizations--by the middle of this month?

11531349049	110000	Yes, Mr. Luetkemeyer, I would agree absolutely with that. I think in the case of the leveraged lending guidance, we do accept and understand that that is nonbinding guidance. In fact, since the GAO ruling, we have made it a point to go out and make sure that that message is getting out to supervisors of banks.    We are also thinking of--we are in discussions and thinking about other ways we can underscore that, perhaps putting it out for further comment.

11635589003	001000	I do not want to speak about particular troop levels. I will leave that to the Department of Defense. But I can talk about the policy. The President has made clear he wants to put as few American soldiers' lives at risk as he possibly can and do so while achieving America's important policy interests. I think we can do that.    By the way, I have a senior State Department official who is working diligently to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 and to work with the Turks and with the Kurds to create conditions on the ground, in the real estate that separates Syria and Turkey, so that we can continue to maintain the vigilance that led to the destruction of the caliphate.    It is a longer answer, but this fits inside our policy throughout the Middle East, whether it is Iraq or in Syria, the work that we are doing to help Lebanon, the work we are doing with our Gulf partners to achieve precisely what it is I think you describe, a secure situation for the American people and an increase in the stability throughout the Middle East.	I just want you to know that I have here the OIG's email confirming that they have no problems with the Department providing these documents to Congress. It has just been very frustrating, and I am sure you can understand, the stonewalling we have been getting for over a year now. And it is very frustrating. All we want to know is what we are entitled to know. A call from your staff just days before this hearing in which they did not agree to produce any documents is really not a good-faith effort. So, I would hope, based on what you have said, that you will provide us the documents the committee requested, and I hope you can do that within 1 week. There is nothing outlandish or outrageous. We are just trying to do our jobs.    I want to ask you a question about Syria. I am very worried about President Trump's statement that we are going to pull out of Syria. I do not want the United States to be in a foreign country any more than we have to, but pulling out of Syria would be a betrayal to the Kurds, our faithful allies for many, many years; saved American lives. It would create problems for our ally Israel because it would put the Iranian regime right on Israel's border. And if and when we ever had to come back, it would probably result in more American casualties. Right now, we seem to have the situation pretty much in hand.    So, I hope that the President's precipitous statement that we were going to, after he allegedly spoke with Mr. Erdogan of Turkey, that we were going to pull out of Syria soon, immediately, or whatever, is not the truth, is not so, and that we have rethought it.

11532380153	100000	Well, the President--President Obama--indicated multiple times that he felt that DACA--he didn't have the power to do DACA in the way it was done. And eventually they must have changed their mind and executed this policy to take persons who were in the country unlawfully and to give them lawful status, work permits, and even participation in Social Security.    So I felt, for some time, that that was not proper. A Federal district court in Texas so held, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals also so held that it was unlawful. So what happened was, we helped work on the research, but the Department of Homeland Security withdrew the policy because it was not defensible, in my view.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Sessions, for your testimony here today and your service to our county over the years that you have been front and center.    A number of things I wanted to discuss.

11532380055	100000	I did chair that meeting.	Thank you.    Now, I want to show you an image from March 31, 2016, of a meeting of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee, which you chaired, with yourself in attendance, along with then-candidate Donald Trump and Mr. George Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos pled guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI.    The charging papers filed by Special Counsel Mueller describe the March 31 meeting, where Mr. Papadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could help arrange a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to communicate with the Russian Government on behalf of the Trump campaign and appears to have told several senior campaign officials about it.    Now, here is the problem. On October 18 of this year, you said under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, quote, ``A continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian Government did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.''    Senator Franken asked, ``You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?'', to which you responded, ``I did not, and I'm not aware of anyone else that did,'' unquote.    Now, we now know that, one, the campaign had communications with the Russians through Mr. Papadopoulos and others, and, two, you seem to have been aware of the fact at the time. So let's try and correct the earlier testimony now for the record.    ``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?	``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?

Well, I think we should, and I think, Mr. Chairman, we should make that request formal in terms of our committee, if not for the whole membership of the House.    Yesterday, I had a hearing here in our Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia. And as part of that hearing, we dealt with the historic 70-year alliance that we had with Europe, one of the most successful alliances in modern history, if not the history of Europe itself.    And one of the things that came across to me in a recent trip there about three and a half weeks ago was the concern with the officials there. Let me give you one example that really was difficult for me to address when I was asked. The EU officials that we met with, they used words like ``painful'' and ``hurtful,'' and they meant it sincerely, when they were talking about how they felt from actions of the United States.    And one thing they said, in particular, was that the emergency security powers that we used to assess the tariffs that were there struck them, because they asked the question, ``You are using emergency security powers to create tariffs on our closest allies.'' And they were asking us--and maybe you could help us with this--when did they become a security risk to the United States?

11531349000	101000	Mr. Chairman, interest on excess reserves is currently the principal policy tool that we use to keep the Federal funds rate in the range that we designate. We have not made a decision in the longer run whether that will continue to be our framework or whether we will return to something more like what we did before the crisis.    I don't have a schedule for--I don't expect to be returning to that decision in the near term. I would just say that our current approach seems to be working very well. It gives us control over rates, and the market seems to understand it.	Thank you, Chairman Powell.    The Chair now yields to himself for 5 minutes.    Chairman Powell, in your statement, you used the term ``normalization.'' I would like to explore that for a moment, and particularly with respect to interest on excess reserves.

11635589087	101000	It is something that previous Administrations and this Administration continue to review. We have to place it in the context of our larger policy, Indo-Pacific policy, even more broadly. We are trying to make sure that we get each of these steps right.    What President Trump has directed each of us to do is recognize facts on the ground, try to apply good common sense, and then, generate policies that actually get outcomes. I think for an awful long time, we have done things that made us feel good, but did not deliver. And so, with respect to this particular issue, and all the issues that surround it in Asia, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people. And so, as we consider the appropriateness of a lot of decisions on designations, on sanctions, on how the Department of Defense is going to posture, how we work with Southeastern countries, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And, Mr. Secretary, it is great to see you. We are proud of your service in this body and your current efforts.    I want to begin by applauding the President and your Department for taking steps to recognize the Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As you might recall, I wrote you a letter last year in that regard, encouraging that recognition. And I just think at this time, with Iran and their proxies, terrorist organizations, the IRGC, Hezbollah, all on the border, there is no more an important time than now to take this action. And I speak for all the people in the district that I am privileged to represent that are proud of this action, support it, and just say thank you very much.

In addition, the national search firms have a very large presence in the candidate population and know who is out there, know who would be a good candidate. They are always trying to find new candidates, and we are too.    It is something we work very hard at and are always interested in having new ideas for qualified candidates as well. We invite the general public generally to offer their thoughts, as well as some of the interest groups.	I appreciate that. I am sure that you are committed to that.

11531349017	100000	Thank you, Ranking Member Waters. I have been involved. This is the seventh process to select a reserve bank president that I have been involved in since I joined the Fed in 2012, so I am very familiar with the way the process works.    We always insist that the search committee, which consists of the B and C directors of the Reserve Bank, hire a national search firm. We always insist--and they don't need to be pushed into this, this is something they want to do--we always insist that there is a highly diverse candidate pool and that diverse candidates are given serious consideration and every chance to become the successful participant in that process.    I can absolutely guarantee you that that will continue to be the case. We will always have diverse candidates. They will always have a fair shot.    I cannot in any individual case guarantee that there will be a diverse outcome, but I can guarantee that the process will be working in that direction.	Thank you very much.    Chairman Powell, with a permanent voting seat on the FOMC, and its role in supervising some of the largest and most complex financial institutions in the country, the president of the New York Federal Reserve has one of the most important economic policymaking roles in the Nation.    Bill Dudley will step down this year. The search for his replacement is under way. Historically, the New York Fed's close proximity to Wall Street has led to the selection of an individual with close ties to the financial sector.    In your view, how important is it that the individual chosen is a diverse candidate, with demonstrated independence from Wall Street and a strong commitment to the Fed's maximum employment mandate and regulatory responsibilities?    What steps is the board taking to ensure that candidates from diverse gender, racial, and ethnic backgrounds are given due consideration? If diverse candidates are not afforded due consideration, are you prepared to exercise your power as Chair to reject such candidates to serve as the next president of the New York Fed?    I know you have a lot on your plate, but I have to put this question to you because we have to do better about diversity, in particular at the highest levels. Not only am I looking at what is happening with the New York Fed and the possibility there, but we have to look at our own Fed, and think about how diverse is it at the top levels, management levels.

11531349044	101000	I do think our post-crisis policies were effective. I haven't carefully studied that report yet, but let me say that what these reports try to do is they try to identify the surprise element in a particular Fed announcement and isolate that from what was already priced into the market.    Most things that happen on announcement day are already priced in. It is very hard to isolate that surprise element. This paper takes a different way of doing that, and it comes up with the answer that comes in.    Overwhelmingly, studies of the effects of asset purchase programs suggest that asset purchase programs did their job, which was to create downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through the term premium. I would say that that is very likely the case.	Last, Chairman Powell, last week, several academics published a paper claiming that the Fed's quantitative easing programs during the Great Recession were largely ineffective at stimulating the economy. New York Fed President Dudley and Boston Fed President Rosengren disagreed and said that they thought that quantitative easing had been effective.

11531349065	100100	Thank you, Mr. Royce. Of course we don't do fiscal policy at the Fed, but I will accept your invitation and just say that it is very important that the Federal Government and government generally be on a sustainable fiscal path, meaning as the baby boomer generation retires, we will need to address the significant fiscal issues that are coming to us over time. I think it is important that Congress do that.    At the same time, the debt ceiling should be something that we always raise in a timely fashion. There is no other country in the world that has a separate vote over whether to pay bills that we have already agreed to incur. I think the United States has never defaulted on a principal or interest payment and never should.    I think doing so would be something I would really hate to see and could bring very significant consequences.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being with us here today. I also wanted to thank you for another effort you undertook, and that was in 2011. You spent a considerable amount of time with members of the House, trying to walk them through the debate that we had on raising the debt ceiling.    You were trying to get us focused on all the unintended consequences, which would occur if we did not raise that debt ceiling, and I very much appreciated the time, effort, and facts that you put forward.    You have a new voice now at the Fed. I assume your opinions on the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling remain. I know that in August, it looks as though the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, or have to roll over, $500 billion of debt in August.    If we are in a quasi-default situation in August, then clearly it is a real question as who would want to purchase that debt and at what cost would they purchase that debt? Clearly a premium on that, a 10 percent premium, it would be a $50 billion hit right there to the interest expense, but there is much more than that that would befall the impact on our markets and, frankly, at corporate debt.    Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?	Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?

11635589121	100000	So, I have spoken to my Russian counterpart no less than three times on the issue of Venezuela and their interference, the fact that they are undermining Venezuelan democracy. It was met with precisely what you would expect from them.    We are doing our level best to push back against the capacity of Cuba, who has had intelligence officers and security officers on the ground there today protecting Maduro. It shocks me that the Venezuelan military will tolerate these foreigners, right, coming to run their security service. As a former U.S. Army officer, it would have been embarrassing if a third country had to come in and provide security for the leadership of our country. But that is where we are today.    We are doing our level best to put sanctions in place, to put restrictions in place, and to, more importantly, build our coalition, not just in South America and Central America with the OAS and the Lima Group, but European countries from all the around the world who understand that democratic Venezuela is the only path forward and Maduro has to go before we can get there.	And I am going to give a shoutout to you because I had the opportunity to travel with you for a better part of a day. What I saw you and your team doing I thought was pretty phenomenal, because I have never seen this done before where you were traveling within the States to promote what the State Department does. You were talking to young students to get them involved in thinking about going into a career in the State Department. And I commend you and your team for doing that, because I look back when I grew up as a pretty sheltered life. I did not even think that was a realm of possibility. Again, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that.    I share the same beliefs as Mr. Sires, of my colleague, in regards to Russia, Cuba, China, and Iran, that there is maybe a destabilizing, coordinated effort underway to destabilize the Western Hemisphere. And I think you and I have talked about this, that Venezuela could be but the rubicon, because if Venezuela fails, it will show that Cuba, you know, they cannot survive because they are the ones that have been propping that up.    How do you assess that? And along with that, how should we respond to Russia's interference under the guise of support to the Maduro regime in Venezuela?
