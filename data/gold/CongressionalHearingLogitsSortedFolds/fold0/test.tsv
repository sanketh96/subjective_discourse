Paul Combetta with Platte River Networks posted to Reddit asking how to ``strip out a VIP's (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email.'' He went on, ``The issue is that these emails involve the private email address of someone you'd recognize, and we're trying to replace it with a placeholder address as to not expose it.''

I am very concerned by this troubling pattern of retaliation which is not only potentially illegal but is also creating a hostile environment that is expediting the exodus of valuable expertise from the EPA. In place of those dedicated public servants you are installing industry lobbyists.    Let's look at the case of Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, an expert who fought to finalize a ban on methylene chloride, a deadly chemical used in paint strippers. The New York Times and other media have reported that her efforts were opposed by Nancy Beck, the chemical industry lobbyist you put in charge of regulating chemicals. Just last year, Nancy Beck was being paid by the chemical industry to lobby against chemical regulations.

You brought in Jeff Sands directly from Syngenta, which was facing a very large fine from EPA for failing to protect its workers from a dangerous pesticide, chlorpyrifos.

11636001109	100000	Congressman, I appreciate that question, and I know how Ohio has been dramatically affected by the opioid crisis. We have done a lot at the Department of Justice, and I would like to partner with this committee and I am sure General Barr would as well to combat and have additional tools to combat this opioid crisis. But some of the things that we have done is we set up in 2017 the Opioid Fraud and Detection Unit, which was a way that the Justice Department could utilize data to help combat the devastating opioid crisis. We did the largest healthcare fraud takedown in June of 2018. We set up the PIL Task Force, otherwise known as the Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force, in February of 2018. We set up a really innovative way called Operation SOS, which was Synthetic Opioid Surge. General Sessions and I went down to Tampa, Florida, where we saw Manatee County had taken an AUSA and embedded them once a week into the sheriff's office in order to take every fentanyl overdose case, and they dramatically reduced the number of overdose deaths in Manatee County. And we decided to take that model and apply it to the most affected States and districts that could really make a dramatic difference in saving lives.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Acting Attorney General, as you mentioned earlier, there are other important matters within the purview of the Justice Department and within the oversight responsibilities of this committee besides fishing expeditions, trying to get the goods on this President in an apparent effort to impeach him. For example, 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. I am old enough to remember back in the mid '80s when President Ronald Reagan and his wife felt so compelled to do something about the scourge of drugs in this country that the effort to just say no began and other efforts following that, and that was because back at that time, we had 10,000 deaths a year due to drug overdoses, and we now have over 70,000 deaths. So it is gotten, unfortunately, over time worse, not better. And most of the increase in deaths in 2017 were due to synthetic drugs, synthetic opioids specifically, like fentanyl, which accounted for a significant number of those deaths. This is clearly an epidemic which has been declared a state of emergency nationwide by the President and has deeply affected families in my home State of Ohio as well as families all across this Nation.    What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?

11636001065	110000	Congressman, that is a, as you know, an important question. It is also--Mr. Stone is part of an ongoing investigation, but I have, again, been briefed on the special counsel's investigation. That would have been--you know, that would have been considered a development that I would have been briefed on, and I was briefed on that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Again, it is playing out exactly as we thought. This is my colleagues across the aisle, when we had questions about the FBI's operation and investigations, it was: Oh, stay away; we don't want to get close to Mueller.    In fact, the Chairman even said, you know, it is no longer okay to wait for Robert Mueller. Well, let's no longer wait. They have got you in front of them right now, so get ready. This is all this is going to be DOJ oversight. And it is--I am just going to say for a second there is some things interesting here that you did point out in your opening statement that do need addressing. I think there is a lot of things, whether it be voting rights issues, whether it be civil rights issues and other things, and I get that, but I am also going to deal with something that is directly under your oversight supervision, Mr. Acting Attorney General, and we are going to talk about because something I have written a letter about, and believe me, I believe that lying before this body or any body is wrong, especially under oath, and that is not the issue.

11636001090	101000	Congresswoman, thank you for that question. I would refer you to the special counsel regulations that, again, the question that I was--the--the answer that I gave to the inquiry was regarding the timing of the special counsel's investigation. I have nothing, as I sit here, to add to that. But I do want to mention that the special counsel's regulations by their very nature say that the Attorney General will receive a report, that that will be a confidential report, and that that will--that report will cover the decisions. And so I was talking about as Attorney General if--as Acting Attorney General, if and when I received that report, again, I only have less than a week, as you know, before Mr. Barr comes on board, that I would review those decisions pursuant to that report.

11636001069	110000	Ranking Member Collins, the court had a sealed indictment that after Mr. Stone's arrest was unsealed. Consistent with all of its prior indictments, the DOJ's basic policy for transparency in criminal cases is that the indictment is posted on the DOJ web page promptly after it is unsealed, and then media outlets were notified.    We do not know of any, and I do not know of any, other Special Counsel's Office notice or DOJ notice to media outlets regarding Mr. Stone's indictment or his arrest and otherwise--you know, I really, as I sit here today, don't have any other information that I can talk about regarding Mr. Stone.

11422125144	000100	I can't at this point. What I can say in response to the first part of your question, any hacking is something we take very seriously. Any hacking in connection with this Nation's election system is something we take extraordinarily seriously, the whole of government. So it is something the FBI is spending a lot of time on right now to try and understand. So what are they up to and what does it involve and what is the scope of it to equip the President to decide upon the appropriate response. And so that is one of reasons I have to be very careful about what I say about it. That work is ongoing. I should make clear to folks when we talk about our election system, there has been a lot of press reporting about attempts to intrude into voter registration databases. Those are connected to the Internet. That is very different than the electoral mechanism in this country, which is not.	All right. I am hoping that we can get some insight in an appropriate classified setting on that.    Now, we have watched with some concern--and I know you are also concerned--about the Russian intrusion into our election system. It has been reported to us that the Russians hacked into the Democratic National Committee database. They also hacked into the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

11531504057	100000	You know, we just issued a series of grants across the country this week with respect to the Brownfields Program, and you are right. It has been a tremendous success reclaiming polluted areas across this country to allow communities to once again enjoy those areas. And so with the partnership of Congress, the increased omnibus, you know, provided additional monies there for us to enhance that program, we are administering those grants and seeking to partner with communities all over the country to ensure that these areas are cleaned up and re-purposed and able to be enjoyed again by those communities.	As you know, Mr. Administrator, last year, and then I think we actually passed it into law this year, this committee unanimously, I believe, here and in the House, rewrote America's Brownfields Legislation and we are working together to rewrite the Safe Drinking Water, clean Drinking Water Act as well and make additional grants available.

11531504117	101000	Congress has been very helpful in providing a small refinery exemption under the statute. It is objectively determined. It is 75,000 barrels, as you indicated, production and we have received I think 24 applications in 2017, a little bit over 30 in 2018. And I would say to you that the volatility of the RIN trading platform is creating instability across the entire RFS discussion.    So it is really in everyone's best interest to get more clarity and confidence in how this RIN trading platform and relief needs to occur. It is going to benefit the ethanol industry, benefit the ag sector, and I think benefit those that are suffering with the RIN obligations. And so it is our hope that we can chart a path forward with Congress to achieve those kinds of outcomes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Administrator, for coming before us. I think that was the first policy question you got from the other side of the aisle. Observation.    And to the public, I think this has been a lot of a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that we are seeing too often here in Washington that, unfortunately, I think works against civility and respect for people in public office. I am hoping we would be able to stay on policy today as much as we could, but I can see some just can't resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand.    So, having said all that, I thank you for what you have done. You have been able to stay disciplined on these policies. I know in West Virginia the impact that it has had on Brownfields Legislation of what you are doing on that I see the rollback of some of the regulatory reform that there is hope now. A lot of the people in the fossil fuel industry that they could see that deterioration in the past 8 years prior to that. There is some hope. We are seeing the economy start to rebound thanks to you and the administration of taking this fight on.    So I know that if I could, I know just as an example, here was an example that despite what has been said to the achievements that you have made that the EPA just awarded $1.9 million to research in drinking water having to do with Flint, that research in Flint. People are ignoring the progress that we are making and they are trying to make this another attack on President Trump, and unfortunately there are a lot of people that are going to go along with that.    So if we could, if I could get back to one of the things that has disturbed me some with some of the events over the last numbers of years was we had a good friend in Leslie Lampton who passed away last week. Lampton has Ergon Refinery located in Mississippi but they have the only refinery in West Virginia. It is a small, kind of a boutique operation at 23,000 barrels. I know the definition of a small refinery is 75,000 barrels, so they are a third of the size. But yet, so they are struggling meeting all of the qualifications, all the requirements of a major refinery.    Is there something that we could work together or something to help out these small refineries so that they can compete? Because they can't handle the RINs, they don't have a market for that with them. So is there something that we could be doing to help out these boutique refineries?

11637282144	100000	Yes. Yes.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Kerner, President Trump appointed you to this position. But that's irrelevant, of course, because you're a professional committed to the rule of law and you're governed by the Hatch Act itself.    I want to ask you about the Hatch Act, because I've got 65,000 constituents who are Federal employees. They've been told they cannot wear a button to work that says resist. They cannot talk about impeachment on the job. And the way I understand it is they can do whatever they want on their own private time in terms of electoral activity, but when they come to work they're there to work. They're not there to campaign for or against anybody.    Is that a basic intuitive understanding of the statute?	Is that a basic intuitive understanding of the statute?

11531504023	001100	This effort----	Well, then, I am concerned that you have no idea of what is going on in your name at your Agency, especially on an issue already under IG investigation. You have spent this week claiming to champion transparency, but on Tuesday you blocked the press from attending an event where you announced a new proposal that will severely limit the Agency's use of public health studies in policymaking.    When internal emails came out about this new policy last week, they revealed that it had been developed entirely by political staff, seemingly without a robust outside stakeholder process, and once the press started covering those emails they were removed from the Agency's public FOIA portal. I do not know if you were personally involved in the decision to remove those emails, but it certainly was not transparent.    Mr. Administrator, you like to claim that you support the rule of law and acknowledge the limits of EPA's authority. Many of our environmental statutes are clear. EPA must use the best available science as a foundation of policymaking. This proposal would prevent that.

11636001094	001000	Congresswoman, thank you for that question. I came to Washington, D.C., in October of 2017 to be Attorney General Sessions' chief of staff. I have the greatest respect, as you know, for General Sessions, and I am really, you know, honored to carry out the role of Acting Attorney General.	All right.

I mean, you have just mentioned today the Roger Stone indictment, and that is an ongoing matter, but let me get back to an opportunity you have to clear the air.

The letter said this: ``On August 8, 2016, Roger Stone, a Donald Trump confidant, revealed that he has communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about the upcoming release of additional illegally hacked Democratic documents.

11637282031	001001	I'm not in a position to judge a statement like that. The way OSC works is we get complaints about statements. There is an investigation opened and started, and we don't just give----	Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note at the outset that, while the Hatch Act does not apply to--it does not Members of Congress. And it is always interesting to hear from my friends on the other side about the blending of political and official when every day we see examples of elected officials using their current positions to propel their Presidential campaign messages.    Having looked through the materials in preparation for this hearing, I can't help but feel that the Office of Special Counsel's interpretation of the Hatch Act means that President Trump's top advisers must subscribe to the legal and political fiction that you can decouple an opponent's Presidential campaign from their current elected position.    And my concern with the OSC's interpretation of the Hatch Act at least appears to be bipartisan. Chairman Cummings even sent a letter to OSC on December 7 of last year, and here's a direct statement: OSC's guidance is wrong. There is no limit that criticizing a policy of a sitting President or any other politician is a violation of the Hatch Act.    Apparently that applies unless you're an adviser to this President.    But all that aside, President Trump's advisers are going to continue to act as his surrogates. So going forward, maybe we can help--maybe this hearing can help us understand what a senior counselor to the President is allowed to say on TV or social media without personally offending Mr. Kerner or anybody else in the OSC's office.    So if we're talking about a sitting Senator and we're talking about Medicare for All, I mean, is it okay to say I hope Bernie Sanders Medicare for All proposal is purely campaign rhetoric, because if he were to introduce a Senate bill which actually provided a $32 trillion pay-for, people would have to give up the coverage they trust, and taxpayers would be on hook for trillions of dollars?

Obviously you don't want to admit what it does. Despite all your scandals, the White House says you have the President's support because you are implementing his deregulatory agenda, but I think that agenda has real costs. In October 2017, right before EPA abandoned the rulemaking, Drew Wynne, a 31-year-old small business owner in South Carolina, died while using methylene chloride. Drew's brother is here today, and I want to thank him for traveling here from South Carolina and continuing to advocate for a ban of this deadly chemical.

11422125026	100000	I can't from personal experience. It wouldn't surprise me if it happened.    The FBI has no ability to decide who comes to an interview in a voluntary interview context.

11637282024	101100	Well, Mr. Chairman, I think from OSC's perspective, we try to apply the law as fairly as we can. To emphasize what I said in my opener, we're going to treat the well-connected the same as the little guy we are going to have one standard. We're not going to have a two-tier Hatch Act enforcement system. Obviously, cases with ordinary Federal workers go to the board, the board sometimes also imposes punishment that may differ from what we recommend.    So sometimes that's simply--imposing discipline is not something OSC does, but we are going to bring cases fairly and equally, and that's what we've done here.	I wonder if you've got, again, these 2 million Federal employees, and I'm sure these cases do come up, and where they may have one violation. I mean, you know, we talk about fairness, I mean, if a person had one or two violations, here we have somebody who has 25 alleged violations, and basically nothing happens.

Mr. Attorney General, we are not joking here, and your humor is not acceptable.

11637282022	100000	Yes. Yes, sir. That is the harshest penalty, obviously, in a civil case like this. We did not take that lightly. It was based on the recommendation of the career folks who prepared the report. It's consistent with MSPB, Merit Systems Protection Board precedent, and it's based on the fact that we have never had a repeat offender. We've never had anyone that we had to write two reports to a President to. We've never had a situation where there were so many violations. And then ultimately she made a comment that seemed to suggest that she didn't feel she was bound by the Hatch Act. So there's no way to stay in Federal employment while she doesn't feel she's obligated to abide by this law.	On June 13, 2019, OSC released another report that found that Ms. Conway broke the law dozens of times.

11531504126	101000	I think Mr. Kelly, if he is willing to share that with you, he should do that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do want to ask a couple questions about the Superfund program, particularly about your friend Mr. Albert Kelly, who you put in charge of the program despite his past. He was scheduled to appear before the committee in January, but he backed out at the last minute, citing travel obligations. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were disappointed in that, but Mr. Kelly sent a letter for the record that he would be willing to answer any and all of our questions regarding his lifetime ban from the banking industry and the illegal activities that led up to that.    It is now more than 3 months later, we have gotten no information from Mr. Kelly. We are told that political leadership has been preventing him from speaking with us, and if that is true, that is certainly disappointing. Two weeks ago, you were interviewed on Fox News by Ed Henry, and he asked you several questions about Mr. Kelly. In the interview, you said that the details of the settlement with the FDIC were private, and that none of us really know what happened.    So my question is, if Mr. Kelly is happy to share the details of his lifetime banking ban as a matter of transparency, is he not telling us the truth, or are you stopping him from doing that?

You know, I listened, Mr. Administrator, to your reasons why you haven't resigned and basically you said that you are staying because only you can carry out the President's mission.

11531504000	111000	Well, Mr. Chairman, I think both are important, and I do think there are some regulatory options that we can pursue. Many have talked about transparency as an example with respect to the trading platform and the RFS trading platform, how long you can hold a RIN as an example, who can buy, who can sell RINs. There are those kinds of, I think, evaluations that we can engage from a regulatory perspective. And, as you know, there is also consideration about the RVP waiver and the E15 being allowed year-round.    I think that is something, it is a legal determination. It is not a policy determination. And we have been earnest the last several months evaluating that in hopes that we can get to a conclusion on our ability to take those kinds of actions. But I really believe that Congress' role in this is terribly important because as you look at the issues that we are facing with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard and the viability of the RINs platform we need both Congress and our regulatory responses to be working together.	The gentleman yields back his time. The Chair thanks the Administrator. I will start the series of questioning, and I will recognize myself for 5 minutes for the first round.    We have obviously a lot of media presence here. I have been asked the last couple days what am I going to do, what am I going to say, and I said, ``Well, I am going to talk policy and stewardship.'' So half my 5 minutes is going to be on a policy issue, and hopefully that will save some time for us to talk about some stewardship issues.    Since you last testified before the subcommittee, the White House has hosted a number of meetings, some of which have included you and other Cabinet officials, senators, and various stakeholders, to discuss changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard. As I alluded to in my opening statement, those potential administrative actions hang like the sword of Damocles over efforts on Capitol Hill to reach an enduring, legislative solution to the problems of that program.    Are any of these administrative changes imminent, or will you commit to allowing Congress time to work on a legislative solution?

11636001038	001010	Mr. Chairman, I see that your 5 minutes is up, and so--I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to a 5-minutes round, and----	I don't think you did, but let me just say this: Your iteration of the Department's longstanding policy appears designed to delay answering these questions as long as possible. I find that unacceptable. I understand the role of executive privilege and respect its value in our system of governance. However, Congress is a coequal branch of government. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight. This is a responsibility we take very seriously.    I have repeatedly tried to work with your office first in delaying the hearing until February and then in providing you our questions in advance. I did this because the executive branch's own rules governing assertion of privilege, which were issued by President Reagan and have been followed ever since, say that ultimately it is up to the President to decide whether or not he wants to assert executive privilege. You cannot repeat forever that the President might want to assert privilege.    I have given you a fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing and to speak with the White House in advance so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that. The Department's failure to do its due diligence here to me is deeply troubling. I do not believe that issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem, but I am going to give you the opportunity to rectify the situation.    After today's hearing, we will attempt to reach an accommodation with the Department to obtain answers to these questions. As part of that process, I ask for your commitment to return for a deposition before this committee in the coming weeks under oath with an understanding that the transcript will be released to the public as soon as practicable thereafter.    Any questions that are unanswered today or require consultation with the White House will be asked again at that proceeding, and I expect either a clean answer or a proper assertion of privilege claimed by the President. I would ask members on both sides of the aisle to make those questions clear for the record so we know what must be addressed at the future proceeding.    Now, in your capacity as Acting Attorney General, have you ever been asked to approve any requests or action to be taken by the special counsel?

11637282098	100000	That's correct.	I thank the chairman.    I thank the witness for being here today appearing before the committee.    I would suggest to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, he must not be saying when he's saying that he's seeking one honest that everyone on this side of the aisle is somehow dishonest. I know that can't be the case, particularly when some of us have broken ranks, for example, offering and asking for a subpoena with respect to child separation policies.    But to suggest that we're somehow dishonest by saying you're seeking to find one honest man because we believe that this is a charade and a waste of the time of the American people, I think that that is a questionable direction to go.    And with respect to the Obama years, I would just raise that it would be awfully nice if my colleagues on the other side would recognize the President sent up a request for $762.8 million for ICE when the problem that we had on our border was nothing like it is today. And yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to recognize that.

11422125045	000001	I can't say, sir. As I said in response to a different question from the Chairman, we don't confirm or deny investigations.	Thank you.    On August 30, I wrote to you regarding Donald Trump's extensive connections to the Russian Government. The letter cites to a number of troubling reports, some that suggest mere conflicts of interest, others that might suggest evidence of a crime.    Last Friday, we read a new report suggesting that Mr. Trump's foreign policy adviser has been meeting with high-ranking, sanctioned officials in Moscow to discuss lifting economic sanctions if Mr. Donald Trump becomes President. The same report quotes, ``a senior United States law enforcement official,'' who says that this relationship is being, ``actively monitored and investigated.''    Is the FBI investigating the activities of Mr. Trump or any adviser to the Trump campaign with respect to any line of communication between the campaign and the Russian Government?

Sir, I need to move on. I take that as a yes.

The judgment I made in this case is, given the unusual--in fact, I hope unprecedented--nature of this investigation, that it was appropriate to offer that transparency. Not an easy call. I really wrestled with it, but I think, on balance, it was the right call.	Okay.    My final question is the following. You investigated Secretary Clinton's emails and so forth, everything we have been talking about. You concluded, I believe quite properly, there was nothing to prosecute. And you have announced, in my opinion quite properly, that you had investigated it and there was nothing there--or there was nothing to prosecute. That was proper.    But having announced--when a prosecutorial agency announces that ``we have investigated so-and-so and we have decided to prosecute because'' or ``we have investigated so-and-so and we have decided not to prosecute because,'' why is it appropriate for that prosecutorial agency to go further and say, ``Even though we decided not to prosecute, we still think this person did this, that, or the other thing and it was proper or improper''?

11636001121	001101	Congresswoman----	I thank the Chairman very much.    These are extraordinary times, Mr. Attorney General. We know that the former Director of the FBI testified to the House Intelligence Committee in open hearing that there was an active investigation into the associates of the Trump campaign, and he was fired subsequently. Mr. Mueller was then hired. Investigations have secured numerous indictments, convictions, or guilty pleas, and, of course, a deal with perjury charges like obstruction of justice, perjury, false statements. So, at the current rate, we are seeing so many of the Trump organizations being indicted, and with the short time that I have, I want to make sure that your questions are answered in a yes-or-no manner.

Mr. Administrator, you are not the first person to be the victim of, for lack of a better term, Washington politics. You got picked to be the EPA Administrator because of the service you provided for the great State of Oklahoma in fighting some of the Obama administration radical clean air policies. You recommended and I support the recommendation that you made to the President that we withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement. That is a decision that most of the stakeholders at EPA violently oppose.    If you can't debate the policies in Washington, you attack the personality and that is what is happening to you. Republicans do it when it is a Democratic President. The Democrats do it when it is a Republican President. And in my opinion, and it is just my opinion, that is what is happening to you.

11637282134	101000	No. There's a couple other rules. First of all, even though you run every two years--the President declared the day he got elected that he's going to be running again. We did not deem him a candidate until later.    So even though you're running every 2 years, if you choose, there's a date that we take from when you're actually, like, a declared candidate. So that's No. 1.    No. 2, as I indicated, absolutely, as an adviser of the President, you can comment on policies. However, when you ask me about--talk about Democrats and people are running potentially for office, it gets a little bit closer, which is why we have a very robust advisory function.

11531504107	101000	If they provide the data and methodology to the Agency and the findings, it will be used.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Pruitt's ethical violations as the head of an Agency with a mission to protect the public's health demonstrate a concerning lack of integrity and a pattern of the rich and powerful putting their rich and powerful friends and their own self-interest above the interest of the public's health and at the expense of the common good. Clean air to breathe and safe water to drink is not a privilege only for the rich and powerful but a right for everyone, and the role of a public servant is to serve and protect the public, in particular the public's health.    However, the gross elimination of many public health protections are kickbacks to the rich lobbyists and corporation friends that have a real impact and I want to highlight one example. This week the EPA announced that it intends to limit the kind of scientific studies it will use in issuing new protections to only studies that make public the private, personal, confidential information of the people who participate in those studies.    Revealing that info is a clear ethical violation of any reputable research institutional review board in the United States. The type of studies you want to exclude are the same kind of scientific studies that were used to prove that lead in pipes and paints harm children and that secondhand smoke is a dangerous carcinogen. We are talking about landmark studies such as the Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study which proved a connection between air pollution and early death back in 1993. That just by living in a city with poor air quality your average life expectancy was lower than those who didn't. This study later became the basis of fine particulate matter regulations in the Clean Air Act.    When you were here in December, you and I spoke about fine particle matter which, thanks to studies based on confidential patient health information, we now know is associated with premature death, asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and respiratory diseases. You acknowledge these risks and agree that there is no safe level of fine particle pollution, but your new policy would block EPA from considering the studies that have shown these dangerous health implications.

11636001113	110000	Congressman, absolutely there is a connection between the drugs that are being imported through our southern border, which is a large majority of those drugs, and the opioid crisis we now face. In fact, I went to China in August as chief of staff for then General Sessions. He asked me to go to talk to the Chinese about what more they could do to reduce the amount of fentanyl that is being produced in China, and we had a nice dialogue with some high-level government officials. And the President, as you know, has agreed with General Xi to reduce fentanyl and eliminate fentanyl production in China. And one of the ways that China has agreed to do that was by scheduling the analogs of fentanyl. It is a very serious problem, and I know Ohio is dramatically affected by it.	Along the same topic, and the President addressed this to a considerable degree in his State of the Union the other night. And do you have an opinion; is there a relationship between enhancing border security, particularly at our southern border, and making at least some progress in reducing the scourge of drug addiction in this country?

11531504002	011000	Well, as you know, under the statute we have an ability to reset those volume obligations, and we are evaluating that. There is a cap of 15 billion for conventional presently. But another area, Mr. Chairman, that I know you have been interested in is high octane. And with respect to--it was mentioned in some other comments about the CAFE standards. There needs to be a serious consideration of us pursuing as a country fuel choices and options to meet those CAFE standards and provide high octane as an option to the American people. I think there is a potential that will serve both the ag sector as well at the auto sector and consumers across this country that we could pursue together.	Well, let me just tell you from my perspective what happens as we are trying to get our disparate groups together is that every time someone gets hauled down to the White House the other side goes crazy.

11636001071	100000	Mr. Collins, I share your concern with the possibility that a media outlet was tipped off to Mr. Stone's either indictment or arrest before it was made, that information was available to the public.	Well, given your answer even just then, it does seem concerning given the timing of this reporter's knowledge and other things that there seems to have been a gap in that discovery. And just another question is, if anybody was outside this, would you view this as a problem? Because this looks like this is something--I am just going to ask you, in your final days here, would this be a problem with DOJ if we are looking at the timing doesn't match up, that somebody was--it seems to appear this was given pre or prior knowledge, not going through the normal channels? Because if it was given through normal channels, every media outlet would have been there, but only one was.

I am very concerned that when a fact witness represents a client who might be the target of an investigation there is a conflict of interest.    And, you know, rather than letting Ms. Mills make a determination, would the FBI be willing to refer the matter of a fact witness, Ms. Mills in this case, representing a target, Secretary Clinton in this case, to the appropriate bar association for investigation?
