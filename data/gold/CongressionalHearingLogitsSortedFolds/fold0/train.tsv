It is my understanding, but if there is something other than that, maybe we will followup afterwards. But it seems to me that this is a circumstance that should be easy.

We already took action by banning him from the platform, and we are going to be doing a full audit to make sure that he gets rid of all the data that he has as well.    To your point about Cambridge University, what we found now is that there was a whole program associated with Cambridge University where a number of researchers, not just Aleksandr Kogan--although to our current knowledge, he is the only one who sold the data to Cambridge Analytica.    There were a number of other researchers who were building similar apps. So we do need to understand whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

11426003075	1110	Well, thank you, Congressman.    The culture of the company is strong. And I don't--I know--	So I want you to think about that culture. Because what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina. It doesn't conform to what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis. I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina; we're grateful for it. But what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina.    I wanted to look at your code of conduct that you tout. So let's look at your code of ethics and business conduct. You said in your message as CEO, ``We are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards in how we conduct our business and serve our customers.''    The code of ethics, in fact, says, ``Our code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo and Company and its subsidiaries.'' It also says, ``We are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws.'' And, finally, ``It's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our company's code of ethics and business conduct and understanding that noncompliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.''    You clearly have failed. You've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally. You have broken, and your company has broken, longstanding law. You've broken longstanding ethical standards that you have within your company. This has nothing to do with this debate about Dodd-Frank or anything else. You've broken a longstanding law, and you've defrauded your customers.    How can you rebuild trust? And how can you get through this thing? What standards are you holding yourself to that sends the message to the rest of these folks in your organization who look to you for leadership and guidance? What are you doing to restore that?

11532380000	110100	Mr. Chairman, as a former Federal prosecutor who emphasized gun prosecutions, I've long believed that they have a significant impact in reducing violent crime. Professors, earlier this year, have explained that they share that view based on scientific analysis. It will be a high priority of ours. You are correct that prosecutions fell.    One instance that was raised during the Texas--terrific, horrible shooting at the church there in Sutherland, Texas, was the ability of an individual to get a firearm and whether or not they filed correctly their form before you get one that--it requires questions about criminal convictions and court marshals.    Those prosecutions, I've noticed, have dropped by over 50 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. I think those are worthy prosecutions. And when a criminal is carrying a gun during a criminal act of some other kind, that is a clear and present danger to the public. And those cases are important, and the impact: reduction of crime.	Well, thank you, General Sessions.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions, and I will begin by recognizing myself.    Under your leadership, the prosecution of firearms offenses have increased 23 percent over the same period of the previous year. Furthermore, the number of defendants charged with using a firearm in violent crimes of drug trafficking rose 10 percent over the previous year.    We have a slide which shows the increase as compared to the Obama-era numbers.    What do these increased prosecutions of firearms offenses indicate about the Department of Justice's commitment to fighting violent crime, particularly with the use of firearms, in this country?

11388494119	1011	As I noted, I haven't seen that and can't read it on the chart. I would be delighted to sit down and go over all of those questions with you and with the exempt organizations. All of the TIGTA report didn't blanket say you should never ask questions about this. Thank you for the chart.	Okay. Well, this is put out by the Exempt Organizations Division, same division where all these problems took place over the last three years. It came out, again, just five days after the comment period on the proposed rule ended at the end of February, and I want to just highlight a few of the questions that are asked. So there is a category that says what if the IRS needs more information about your (c)(4) application? New sample questions. So if we could put them up side-by-side.    Now, the first slide are the targeted questions that TIGTA said were inappropriate and that you agree are inappropriate, Judith Kendall agreed are inappropriate. Those are those questions. And now, just five days after the proposed rule comment period ends, you issue a newsletter from the Exempt Organizations Division highlighting the new questions you are going to ask, and I just want to look how similar the two questions are.    Let's just take the second category, whether an officer or director, etcetera, has run or will run for public office. The new question says this: Do you support a candidate for public office who is one of your founders, officers, or board members? It is basically the same. This reminds me of when I was in grade school and the teachers told us you shouldn't plagiarize, so you change a few words and basically plagiarize. This is the same thing.    So here is what I don't understand. If you are trying to comply with the TIGTA report, if the new (c)(4) rule is a way to deal with what the audit said and not as what I believe is a continuation of the project Lois Lerner started, why are you asking the same darn questions?

11426003139	1011	I don't have a precise count of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.    So my question to you, Mr. Stumpf, first is, how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?

11525545181	1101	You represent the Rattlers?	Right. And early on, Congressman Scott spoke about the 1890 institutions, and I happen to represent Florida A&M University that is one of them. And in the early years, there was quite a great deal of interest in agriculture and people returning. In fact, my father-in-law was the farm manager at the university. And it was a great deal of interest to students who were coming out. When I came up, as you say, I was in the FFA, 4-H club, and all of those areas that help you get very acquainted with farm products, growing cattle and poultry, and so forth. But they have been under-funded, and I really feel similar, and I know you have an institution in Georgia, which is right across the line, that we really can enhance that opportunity for students that are going in. You made a statement earlier about, if you don't have these right here, these cell phones and other activities, that is what the young people really need, and the technology that goes along with it.    My question is what can we do when working on the farm bill to make sure that we engage those institutions more with the funding they need to develop more farmers? My father-in-law was at Tuskegee where they did a lot of research with the peanuts and all this other stuff. And so that sets the mould for the future of feeding everyone like you talked about, but those institutions need to get more engaged.

11497630012	111000	Well, Congressman, with respect to the types of cases that are prosecuted, as I indicated, a lot of the firearms prosecutions are done in conjunction with our violent crime program, and they may not show up in your statistics as the lead charges. They are a significant part of the arsenal that every Federal prosecutor utilizes.    Most recently, I've convened a summit with the top elected officials, police chiefs, and leaders of major cities to talk about violent crime that's currently taking place in several major cities, with a focus on finding the causes and finding the best ways to direct Federal resources to those particular cities.	Then why aren't they being prosecuted for those violations related to firearms?    And, by the way, this doesn't just mean using a firearm in the commission of crime. It also means illegal sales of firearms. It means lying on the Instant Check System of which, for the last year for which we have complete data, 76,000 people were found to have committed the felony of swearing to false information on that form. Five thousand were referred for prosecution, but the 94 U.S. attorneys' offices across the country could only find time to prosecute 62 out of 76,000.    So somebody going into a gun store to buy a weapon knows that, even if they're caught--and often they're not caught because the system doesn't have all the information it needs in it--but even if they're caught, they often find that the odds are one in a thousand that they'll be prosecuted even when they're caught.    What are you doing about that? What should be done about it? And why has this decline been so precipitous over the last several years?

11525545139	1101	Well, you mentioned several things. Let me think of that and then I can address your final question. But certainly, from the vigilance over foot-and-mouth, as well as any other disease, Congressman, you know that we thought we were done with screwworms, and yet we have these things break out, and very quickly contained, but you have to be vigilant every day.	Secretary Perdue, thanks for being here. I feel a kindred spirit being a fellow veterinarian. And I don't know whether to call you Doc, Governor, or Secretary. If you are like me, you probably prefer Doc. And I look forward to helping you achieve your mission.    The way you opened up, and everything you have said I am in alignment. And it just sounds like you have common sense. I can only feel that comes from working on the south end of a horse or a cow in your past. But what you were talking about, I look forward to helping you achieve your goal of making a realignment of the USDA to make it the most efficient agency in government. And that is such a critical thing, knowing the debt that our country is facing, we have to do more with less, and I look forward to working with you on that.    And you also talked about the USDA stamp, it should be revered and trusted, and I agree, because that stamp around the world stands for the highest quality product that you can get, and it is so important that we protect it.    And several of the things I wanted to talk about were already talked about. Your understanding of FMD, it is music to my ears. There was a point up here where it wasn't talked about much, and we know the threat. We haven't had that here since 1929. If it comes here, it would be devastating. And certainly, we know what happened with BSE with the three cases that were here, and how long it is just now taking us to recover after 15 years. And that was with no depopulation of any of the herds. And certainly, if we had an FMD outbreak, it would be devastating. It would take years and years to recover, not just our cattle herd but our trade.    And as we look forward, I look forward to working with you on the new farm bill to make continued improvements in the cotton program, as was talked, but not at the expense of other crops, i.e., peanuts. I come from north central Florida, and the cottonseed program is something we talked about, to help give diversification to the cotton growers. And that is something that I hope you would consider looking at. But what we know is with these programs, you can't have one at the expense of the other one. And with peanuts, we certainly know within that one program you have discrepancy because you have the people that have generic and/or base acres, and then you have people that have neither, and they are growing peanuts right next to each other. One is at a disadvantage because they don't fall into a program. And we have seen people switch from cotton to grow peanuts because of the farm program. And there are some things that can be fixed in that, and I hope you will look at that. And not to penalize anybody, just to give that, I guess, parity on one peanut field to the next so that those farmers can stay in business, especially the young farmers that we see.    We have several things that we have put together. What I would like to do is having a meeting with you and maybe your staff, and go over some of the things.    And then coming from Florida, we have over 360 specialty crops in Florida. Florida is known for number one in the nation for melons, sweet corn, and citrus. Even with citrus greening, as Mr. Soto brought up, we went from 470 million boxes, we are down to under 70 million boxes. It is something that has to be dealt with, and we look forward to the robust funding that USDA has done.    And I guess one of my asks for you is, the research and development that we are doing is so vitally important, and again, USDA has been great on this, that we take that research and development, because we know one of the cures is probably going to be a GMO tree, to have the USDA help in marketing those products. And that is something I would like to see USDA get involved now to move to where we can start marketing that stuff.    Do you have any thoughts about that?	Do you have any thoughts about that?

11497630132	101100	I'm saying that I am being consistent to the policy of the Department of Justice that we do not make line attorneys available.	Mr. Conyers is still sitting here at the dais. Mr. Conyers very bravely took on the Bush administration. Where relevant U.S. attorneys and case law effectively now is that in fact if a Committee of Congress wants somebody, it is not a discretion to say no.

11635589143	111000	Yes, look, the good news is I am hopeful that Martin Griffiths, the U.N. Special Envoy in Yemen, in the next handful of days will make progress. He may not. We have a great agreement in Stockholm. We have not been able to enforce it. The Houthis have refused to withdraw from the Port of Hodeidah. I hope that they will in the coming days. Frankly, if I were betting, I would probably bet against, but one lives in hope.    Congress obviously has its own independent right to act as it so chooses. It has its constitutional authorities. I can say this: I hope everyone who cares about the people of Yemen understand that the legislation that passed did not remotely benefit them. Indeed, it will work to their detriment.

11530956047	110100	Congressman, thank you. And let me say a couple of things on this. First, to your point about competition, the average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there is a lot of competition that we feel every day, and that is an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.    Second, on your point about regulation, the internet is growing in importance around the world in peoples' lives, and I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place for a lot of the reasons that you are saying.    I think a lot of times regulation, by definition, puts in place rules that a company that is larger, that has resources like ours, can easily comply with but that might be more difficult for a smaller startup to comply with.    So I think that these are all things that need to be thought through very carefully when thinking through what rules we want to put in place.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome to the committee.    A number of times in the last day or two you have indicated that, in fact, you are now open to some type of regulation. And we know, of course, that you are the dominant social media platform without any true competitor, in all frankness, and you have hundreds, if not thousands, of folks that are--would be required to help navigate any type of regulatory environment.    Some would argue that a more regulatory environment might ultimately stifle new platforms and innovators some might describe as desperately needed competition, i.e., regulatory complexity helps protect those folks like you. It could create a harmful barrier to entry for some startups, particularly ones that might want to compete with you.    So should we policymakers up here be more focused on the needs of startups over large incumbents, and what kind of policy regulation--regulatory environment would you want instead of managing maybe a Fortune 500 company if you were launching a startup to take on the big guy?

Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is under investigation because of his work and ties to foreign governments. According to various reports, much of his work with these foreign governments went unreported when Mr. Flynn was required to make certain disclosures by law.    Now, as chairman of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee and lead adviser on the Trump transition team, I think you worked closely with Mr. Flynn, and I'd like you to answer a few yes-or-no questions about Mr. Flynn. And knowing that Mr. Flynn is under investigation, I'm going to stick to subject matter that predates both the special counsel's investigation and your appointment as attorney general.

11525545134	101100	Regarding the organic issue, certainly, that has become a valuable brand as we see the growth from consumers wanting more of that. The way the oversight works on that from USDA is we authorize or legitimize the certifiers; many times state agencies, to go out and make sure the principles and the processes and the programs that define organic are being carried out. As you might imagine, that is not a 24/7-type inspection. It works much like the Environmental Protection Agency authorizes state EPDs to work in that regard as well.    That is a challenge. Our goal is to have better education of these authorizing certifiers, and to maybe do some auditing out here, not only of the certifiers, but on the ground as well, to do that. We want to jealously guard the legitimate. And there is some legitimate concern regarding cheaters coming into the country with organic labels, that aren't following organic processes. It is a very important responsibility of USDA. We have to leverage that because there is no way for USDA to have enough inspectors on the ground everywhere to certify organics. But in working with our authorized certifiers, and we will just try to do a better job in making sure those people who are violating the rules are not allowed to continue to do that.	Well, we appreciate that.    In addition, we have a large cattle industry in and around my district, including the largest herd in the nation at Deseret Ranch, and we appreciate your commitment to help modernize the North American FMD vaccine bank. I do want to bring to your attention what you may already know, we had a small screwworm outbreak in the Keys, which was a pretty strange place for that to happen. While that is under control, it just highlights that we still have risk to Florida cattle.    And one other thing I know my local cattle ranchers will be sending you an invite to the RAM Rodeo in Osceola County. I encourage you to come along if you can make it, or one of our others. It is part of our tradition there.    The other issue I wanted to bring up is there has been reports that foreign farmers are bringing in fruits and vegetables labeled as organic, that are not organic. And in Florida, we are working on protecting a fruit and vegetable industry that is really struggling under low wages coming through areas like Mexico and Central America.    It is a twofold question. What do you think we can do to assist in making sure organic means just that, particularly from foreign commodities, and what do you think we could do within the NAFTA confines to trigger higher wages under the existing provisions of NAFTA in Mexico and other areas?

As I've indicated, I determined to accept that recommendation and did, in fact, accept that recommendation.	I have a limited amount of time.    You know, the fact is that, whether it's extremely careless or gross negligence and a strict liability of statute, I think that the language of the statute is clear.    Now, I've noted that the Justice Department over the last several years has prosecuted several servicemen for doing the exact same thing that Secretary Clinton did and, in one case, actually reached a judgment of a court that prohibited that serviceman from ever having a security classification again.    Now, you have a problem, Madam Attorney General, that people think that there's a different standard between the servicemen and Secretary Clinton and the fact that the language is almost synonymous, if not synonymous, saying no prosecution of Secretary Clinton and prosecution and conviction of the servicemen.    You have a burden, I think, to convince the American public that you don't have a double standard. You're not meeting the burden. And how do you plan to change the argument that you make to the American public so that they can be convinced that the thing was correct and that you made the right decision, rather than simply deferring to people in the FBI and the prosecutors?

11525545120	101100	One of the things that has not been talked about in our realignment, reorganization had to do with aligning NRCS and their mission area with FSA. That leaves NRE really with the responsibility of managing our U.S. Forest Service. That is where over 1/3 of the employees in USDA are, and that is, frankly, where some of the biggest challenges have come from. We face litigation, we face NEPA challenges, and other kinds of things in order to utilize the renewable resources on all of our millions of acres out here; northern California and many other states, to do that. Actually, that means jobs as well.    The good news, the fact is a healthy forest is less vulnerable to fire, and you all know that the fire budget has kind of gotten upside down in the Forest Service. We are spending more to fight fires than we are to prevent fires. We hope to get that corrected with your help and reestablished. But I believe, again, a mission area that is focused directly on utilizing the renewable aspects; whether it is deadfall going into biomass, or recovering these trees that might be down, they have a certain period of time that you can harvest them and they would be good lumber, to get ahead of that curve. The challenge is right now so much of that budget is spent in suppression rather than prevention, and we have to get ahead of that. But that is my desire.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Mr. Secretary. It is really great to have you here, and I hope things are going well for you in your transition. And it is also very heartening to hear the colleagues that you know the best; our Georgia colleagues, that have welcomed you here today, and the nonpartisan way which everybody likes working with you. That is a really good indicator compared to some of the things going on around this town.    There are so many issues here, and I am hoping, of course, that we see a rebound in ag commodities at the farm gate there, and then we can see exports are expected to come back up a little bit from a peak of just a few years ago.    We have a lot of issues going on. I have a northern California district, top of the state, and one of the things that we are very, very, concerned about is USDA's oversight of the Forest Service and the need to be much better managing our Federal lands, and moving more into biomass using this over-inventory we have of forest products, so that really need to be managed much better, as we have wildfires every year and we need to incentivize the biomass situation.

11525545092	11	I am not sure I can answer that question specifically, other than that I have given my vision, and we are progressing in the protocol, as I understand it, directed by our General Counsel to implement this. I visited with your Chairman and Ranking Member here, the Chairman and Ranking Member of Ag Appropriations to let them know of my plans and to do that. I may not be as attuned to the Federal requirements of permission as they are, but all I know is my heartbeat is to make good and to do well, and to make sure USDA continues to serve the best way. I can't answer the specific process question that you asked.	Yes, we have the legislation, it is just a matter of authorizing the expenditure on that. And I would like to offer an invitation to you to come see the locks and dam system along the Mississippi River. That is the entire western border of my district is the Mississippi, and seeing the locks and dams that were built in the 1930s that really need a lot of attention. But we would love to have you come and visit us, so consider that an invitation.    Quickly shifting gears, yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released a report outlining many of the economic challenges in rural America, which I would like to have entered into the record. But I would also like to acknowledge something that Congresswoman Fudge said earlier, that I am concerned about the Trump Administration budget that calls for a 21 percent cut in USDA, including eliminating Rural Development's water infrastructure programs, and the Rural Business--Cooperative Service. Just a big concern. And that can be echoed, you will probably hear some other questions from my colleagues here. But the reorganization also eliminates the Rural Development mission area entirely, as well as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary, which you have addressed for a moment. But it is my understanding that you have already submitted the reorganization plan to Congress for the mandatory 30 day notification period, however, just today, you sought public comment through a Federal Register notice on the proposal. I was wondering about the formal reorganization plan sent to Congress, why that was presented to Congress before seeking feedback from the impacted stakeholders.

The Taiwan Travel Relations Act is an important piece of legislation. You have seen our Administration do a great deal to implement that. I am sure there is more to follow. I do not want to get too far out ahead of what we are doing.    But, make no mistake about it, we understand the importance of that relationship and, more importantly, we have taken a much fuller view than previous Administrations. This is not partisan. It goes back to Republicans and Democrats alike, the concerns about the risks that China presents to American wealth creation and our continued democracy.	I appreciate that.

11530956129	11000	Congressman, I think you are raising an important point, which is that I think if someone wanted to know, they could. But I think that a lot of people probably just accept terms of service without taking the time to read through it.    I view our responsibility not as just legally complying with laying it out and getting that consent but actually trying to make sure that people understand what is happening throughout the product.    That is why every single time that you share something on Facebook or one of our services, right there is a control in line where you control who you want to share with. Because I don't just think that this is about a terms of service. It is contextual. You want to present people with the information about what they might be doing and give them the relevant controls in line at the time that they are making those decisions, not just have it be in the background sometime or upfront make a one-time decision.	Well, can the average person, the average layperson look at the terms and conditions and make the evaluation, is this a strong enough protection for me to enter into this arrangement?

11420722157	111000	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.	Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.    Can you tell me, General Lynch, whether or not, with respect to the Orlando mass murder, 49 people, innocent people, killed at the hand of a deranged gunman wielding an assault weapon, can you tell us whether or not you found any evidence that the gunman used any encrypted messaging to prepare for his attack?

11525545007	101100	Well, Congressman, I am just beginning today my fourth week on the job, and while we are waiting for some of the other people to get into that, as you know, on the realignment we are talking about the FSA and NRCS and RMA being collocated and speaking with one voice and one database, frankly. But, again, the opportunity to deal with those kind of issues we have not specifically dealt with. I know a topic of interest and concern to you is CRP, I look forward to visiting with you again. I have not given specific directions. My comments about that is we can have some flexibility in the CRP program, maybe take out some of the least productive areas and use them rather than the whole-field type of philosophy we have had with CRP, give a little more flexibility in that way. With the wildfires we gave some flexibility regarding grazing on some of these areas as well. We want to be flexible while we maintain the integrity of the program, and help to train through FSA and NRCS our farmers to utilize their least productive acres; those that cost the most, and they may even have a better, higher net income if we don't try to plant wall-to-wall.	I believe that you have tasked the Farm Service Agency with looking at a revamp of the CRP program. Did you give them any specific direction or are you just having them look at where things are at?

11530956018	1100	Congressman, what we allow with our developer platform is for people to choose to sign into other apps and bring their data with them. That is something that a lot of people want to be able to do.    The reason why we built the developer platform in the first place was because we thought it would be great if more experiences that people had could be more social. So, if you could have a calendar that showed your friends' birthdays, if you could have an address book that had pictures of your friends in it, if you could have a map that showed your friends' addresses on it.    In order to do that, you need to be able to sign into an app, bring some of your data and some of your friends' data, and that is what we built. Now, since then, we have recognized that that can be used for abuse too, so we have limited it so now people can only bring their data when they go to an app.    But that is something that a lot of people do on a day-to-day basis is sign into apps and websites with Facebook, and that is something that we are going----	All right. Now, you said yesterday that each of us owns the content that we put on Facebook and that Facebook gives some control to consumers over their content, but we know about the problems with Cambridge Analytica.    I know you changed your rules in 2014 and again this week, but you still allow third parties to have access to personal data.

But maybe--and not only maybe--some of our people--and, again, it's 1 percent, but that's a big number for a big organization. Anytime--any one time we have 100,000 people in our branch network, and if 800 people, for whatever reason, either misunderstood or used this as a way to be dishonest and break our code of ethics and do something wrong for a customer and something wrong for us, that's why we're removing sales goals. They'll be gone as of this weekend. In fact, we don't even think they're an important requirement anymore for us to continue to grow.

11532380114	1010	I would think that those matters are worthy of consideration. But as to the details of them and for me to express an ultimate comment today, I'm unable to so.	Great. Thank you very much.    I'm not and never was a prosecutor, but I did some criminal defense work back in the day when I practiced law for almost 20 years. It seems to me that a Presidential campaign using a law firm as a conduit to pay for activities with which the campaign itself doesn't want to be directly associated is more than just dirty politics; it's also, quite possibly, illegal. To me, it seems that this is at least a violation of campaign finance laws for failure to accurately disclose the actual recipients of campaign disbursements.    However, this type of arrangement is not illegal--if it's not illegal under current law, I fear that we're risking opening Pandora's box with all sorts of underhanded activities by campaigns being laundered through law firms and shielded under attorney-client privilege.    As the chief law enforcement official in this country, do you share similar concerns?

11420722054	1100	Congressman, with respect to the Director's statements, as I've indicated, he's provided really unprecedented access into his views of the matter, and I would refer you to them.    I understand the issue that you raise, obviously, is one involving perceptions as to whether or not charges would have been brought in some other situation. And, again, I can only refer you back to the Director's statements, where he chose to outline the fact that no other cases similar to this had, in fact, been brought.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Madam Attorney General, I think the thing that I find so disheartening, so unfortunate, about FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week was that, for a lot of Americans, it looked like we're seeing a double standard, unequal treatment under the law.    Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.    Now, I assume that, based upon the way you've answered some of my colleague's questions prior to this, you're not going to acknowledge what I think virtually every other American believes, even her supporters, and that's to at least acknowledge, as Director Comey did, that she lied.

And we have got a great ally in Colombia, and Colombia is doing the right thing by taking care of these folks who are in crises.    It just seems to me that it is in contrast to the position that we are taking on our southern border, because I do not hear any talks--I am now speaking to the members of the Colombian government--they are not saying they are being invaded. They have got millions of people crossing their border every day. They are not saying they are being invaded. There is no talk about building a wall. But, rather, they are calling for a coordination of humanitarian assistance and working within their group.    The fact of the matter is, in talking to some of the Colombian members of their government, I was talking to them not too long ago, yesterday to be a fact, they expect the possibility of a bigger crisis. They say 2-3 million people may be coming across. But they were going to try to make sure they take care of them, not prevent them from coming across.    A stark contrast to the policies that we have on our southern border.

Now, in July of this year, the American Immigration Council and several other organizations filed a class action lawsuit in District Court in the Western District of Washington challenging the validity of removal proceedings for children without appointed counsel. And their argument was that an 8-year-old couldn't receive a full and fair hearing in the immigration court without representation.    As you know, I'm sure, the Administration has made efforts to provide counsel to small children by funding nonprofit groups, but the Assistant Attorney General who argued, I think a Mr. Leon Fresco, actually argued contrary to that in the District Court. And I'm wondering if the Department's position has changed since Mr. Holder left the Department and whether you think it could meet due process to have an 8-year-old who speaks only Spanish appear in immigration court without a lawyer and be able to argue the nuances of immigration law and asylum law.

You may not know this, Mr. Smith, but it is actually considered best practices in a company with lots of sensitive, personal information to have their chief information security officer have independent business lines that report directly to the CEO and to the board of directors.    But at Equifax, you were using an outdated corporate governance model and had your chief information security officer reporting to the general counsel, not directly to the CEO, and board.    So my question is, why was your chief information security officer not reporting directly to you and the board? And why were you using an old model?

11388494100	1001	Needless to say, I wasn't around in 1959, when that regulation was given to the IRS.	Now, if I said to my spouse, honey, we have an exclusive relationship, and I mean by that 49 percent, I would probably have problems in my relationship. To her and to me exclusively means just you all the time, 100 percent. So how in the world did we get to a situation where the IRS, on its own, outside of statutory authority, decided to interpret this as primarily? Because, to me, that is part of the problem. Exclusively ought to mean exclusively. And if Congress wants to change that, we should change the law. But I don't remember Congress investing IRS with the authority to actually decide to interpret it radically different, not just kind of a little fudge factor here. This is radically different.

And one other thing that I had said in my statement is that when it came to the Trump Tower Moscow project, it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and we never expected to win the election. So this was just business as usual.	My question is, given all those connections, is it likely that Donald Trump was fully aware and had every intent of working with Russia to help make sure that he could win the Presidency at all costs?

11532380157	1100	Well, that's hypothetical Senator King. I'm not--I don't think I should speculate on that. But I do think Congress will have to give it thought. We have a law now, it's in place, as Congress passed, and Congress would have to change it.	And there's a lot of public dialogue about what kind of legislation might be passed in conjunction with the DACA policy, and that's up in the air right now. I'm noticing that Democrats are saying: We're going to have everything we want on DACA or we'll shut the government down. So it causes me to think about what should happen if Congress reaches an impasse and there is no passage of any legislation to extend the DACA policy.

11525545035	1100	Certainly, Congressman, I would be happy to answer as best I can. I will admit to you that even when we were in the dairy business, I am not sure I ever understood the Marketing Orders, but I hope to understand it better, going forward.    Back to your original question about diversity of agriculture in California. I had the pleasure this past week of meeting with about 30 of your Western Growers there that comprised California, Arizona, a little bit of Nevada there.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Again, welcome, Mr. Secretary, and we look forward to working with you. And you, like myself and many of us here, reflect generations of farm families, and we obviously welcome you to this important effort as we look at reauthorizing the farm bill.    I don't want to repeat what has been discussed already; Farm Credit, crop insurance, cotton, and dairy, but I would like to focus on some California issues specifically.    As the number one agricultural state, the diversity and the breadth and the width, we take great pride in the production in California, and I know you are aware of it. My California colleagues and I here on the dais would like to invite you sooner rather than later to come out to California where we could have a conversation with our farmers, ranchers, dairymen and women, and talk about the complexity of California agriculture.    Speaking of which, we worked very hard in the last farm bill to provide the opportunity for the California dairy industry to participate in the Federal Marketing Order. We have completed the process of the due diligence. USDA is moving on this Milk Marketing Order. I would like to get your thoughts on the current timeline, and can we tackle this final rule before the end of 2017? As you know, the quota issue, if you haven't been briefed on it, is a key part of whether or not the dairy producers will provide a 2/3 vote to join the Federal Marketing Order.

But, of course, we will work to keep you informed.	Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Madam Attorney General Lynch, when you appeared last time before this Committee, I brought up the case of Darrius Stewart. Darrius Stewart as was a young man, 19 years old, who was shot to death by a Memphis police officer. He was a passenger in a car. The officer stopped the car for a headlight violation and ran a check on the passenger, end up getting in the backseat. Officer shot him, killed him.    Our local prosecutor asked the grand jury to indict for manslaughter, but the grand jury didn't for some reason. I asked the Department of Justice to investigate, and I'm grateful for that. We are eager to know the results of your investigation. We need to know if there are any civil rights violations. Can you please tell us when we might expect any results in that case? I read today in the Times about the Garner case. I know it is difficult, but this case is one that is in Memphis with Darrius Stewart.

11635589064	1100	So, I think it is important to consider all of these things in the context of the challenges from China. You have seen what we have done with respect to Taiwan. It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, as you know, last Congress I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act, and President Trump signed it into law last March. The intention of this legislation was to allow our high-level officials to go to Taipei and to allow their high-level officials to come here to the United States, including Washington. In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations? And can the people of Taiwan count on you to advocate for further implementation of that I think very important legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act?

11426003016	110000	That is correct. And Mr. Chairman, we shut that division down. That was even shut down--	It was in a different business area, but I will read from the consent order: ``Wells Fargo's internal controls were not adequate to detect and prevent instances when certain of its sales personnel, in order to meet sales performance standards and receive incentive compensation, altered or falsified income documents and inflated prospective borrowers' incomes to qualify those borrowers for loans that they would not otherwise have been qualified to receive.''

The Ranking Member brought up the State Director of Rural Development and FSA, when they would be filled. And then Mr. Crawford brought up the practical to replant issue, which hit us right between the eyes in Louisiana with the flooding last year. I appreciate you addressing all those issues.    The quick question I do want to ask is that, with furrow irrigation rice, your agency has allowed that to become an insured crop, and in Louisiana we certainly appreciate that. As you know, with the furrow irrigated rice they tend to use the blast resistant seed. And for those here that don't know what that is, it is a fungus that affects rice and just devastates yields. And if they use that seed; that blast resistant seed, production goes up, yield per acre, and certainly water usage goes down, so it is a great thing. My question is when can we expect final approval of this process to take place?	My question is when can we expect final approval of this process to take place?

11531349006	110000	No, sir. Our intention over the long term is that the balance sheet would be no larger than it needs to be to implement monetary policy, and that it would consist primarily of treasury securities.    We purchased the mortgage-backed securities in the aftermath of the crisis. That was an unusual practice, and it was something that we did in unusual circumstances. Those will run off over time, and I don't expect that we would use that tool again, other than in a very severe situation.	OK. As I understand it, though, I have not been able to see on the public record the expectation with respect to the composition of the balance sheet. I believe that currently you are carrying $2.4 trillion of treasuries, $1.8 trillion of mortgage-backed securities. Is our expectation--that is roughly back of the envelope, one-third, two-thirds ratio. Is it your intention to keep that same ratio of mortgage-backed securities?    Again, many of us are concerned about the possibility of the Fed involved in credit allocation decisions. Because right now, I don't really see a glide path to a treasuries-only balance sheet.

11525545160	110000	Absolutely. Your represented state, it is understood in your poultry industry how much export and how much trade affects that. The good news is we have a poultry ecosystem in this nation; Delaware, Georgia, Arkansas, and across the country, that is just unable to be replicated, from the feed grains and the processing and the growing, and it is a great blessing to do that.    All these tools, we have to have those tools and more available because our producers are going to challenge us. They can grow it, they have demonstrated they can grow it, and the challenge would be to feed that hungry world with trade and export. We need all those tools available.	Okay, great.

11532380015	11	Is that a question?	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome again, Mr. Attorney General.    I'd like to begin by putting a few statements by the President up on the screen.    The first, from July 24, 2017: ``So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General], looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?''    The second, from November the 3rd: ``Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and the FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.''    The third, also from November 3rd: ``Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI and Justice Dept.''    I believe he is referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren in that last one. When Richard Nixon spoke about us that way, at least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors.

11525545039	110000	Absolutely. Again, many of the principles that were included in that, and actually in tandem with the renegotiation of NAFTA, you might see sort of a trilateral TPP. I am just suggesting that, but many of the principles that you all had in these negotiations are still viable, it is just a matter of fine-tuning those in a way that makes sense, I don't think this Administration is not against free trade at all, it really is more concerned to fair trade.	All right, let me move on because we don't get a lot of time here. Obviously, this is a conversation to be continued.    Trade, obviously, is very important. I was disappointed when the President withdrew from all the work that had been done on the TPP.

I would like to see that map that you took to the President and talked about the importance of our trading partners, both in Mexico and Canada.

11532380118	110000	Well, many States have capital punishment. The Federal Government has capital punishment for a number of offenses, and it is specifically controlled. We have within the Department a recommendation process through our appointed committee to seek or not seek a death penalty when a case is charged. Sometimes it's a complex thing.    But I believe the death penalty, the Federal death penalty, is a part of our law. I think it's a legitimate penalty. It's constitutional. And we will do our duty, even in those circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty.	Okay. It seems to me that there's always been a tremendous amount of gray area in that whole field, which I think, as a Nation, you know, we need to look much more closely at, both from the State's point of view and the Federal Government point of view. But that's just my feeling on that.    I'm running out of time. I had about four other things, but let me just go to one final thing here.    I've been very involved in the area of victims' rights. I was the--following Henry Hyde's leadership on this, introduced a victims' rights constitutional amendment years back, various pieces of legislation on victims' rights. And I've also worked closely with the parents of murdered children. And when you talk about something that affects one's family, there's nothing that affects a family more adversely than something like that happening.    And we still have capital punishment on the books, both at the Federal level and many of our States. Yet these families are dragged left and right, up and down, back and forth, into hearing after hearing. These cases can drag on for more than 20 years before the imposition of capital punishment actually occurs. And, in many instances, obviously, it never does.    And while these people are behind bars, oftentimes they attack, sometimes kill guards, attack, sometimes kill other inmates.

11530956113	110000	Congressman, yes. This is an extremely important area. After we were slow to identify the Russian information operations in 2016, this has become a top priority for our company to prevent that from ever happening again, especially this year in 2018, which is such an important election year with the U.S. midterms, but also major elections in India, Brazil, Mexico, Hungary, Pakistan, a number of other places.    So we are doing a number of things that I am happy to talk about or follow up with afterwards around deploying new AI tools that can proactively catch fake accounts that Russia or others might create to spread misinformation.    And one thing that I will end on here, just because I know we are running low on time, is, since the 2016 election, there have been a number of significant elections, including the French Presidential election, the German election, and last year the U.S. Senate Alabama special election.    And the AI tools that we deployed in those elections were able to proactively take down tens of thousands of fake accounts that may have been trying to do the activity that you are talking about. So our tools are getting better.    For as long as Russia has people who are employed who are trying to perpetrate this kind of interference, it will be hard for us to guarantee that we are going to fully stop everything. But it is an arms race, and I think that we are making ground and are doing better and better and are confident about how we are going to be able to do that.	OK. And, finally, let me say this: Many of us are very angry about Russian influence in the 2016 Presidential elections and Russian influence over our Presidential elections.    Does Facebook have the ability to detect when a foreign entity is attempting to buy a political ad, and is that process automated?

11525545019	1100	Congressman Scott, you have identified some real challenges. You talked about the age issue, but those are particularly significant and disadvantage to opportunities as well.	 Thank you very much.    Mr. Secretary, all of Georgia is very proud of you, and this nation will soon find out why. You are a wonderful, wonderful person, and we are delighted to have you as our Secretary of Agriculture.    Mr. Secretary, we are faced with a very serious national crisis, and that national crisis is the expanding age of our farmers. The average age of our farmers is right at 60 years of age. And we in this Committee have put together a bill to address that. It is House Resolution 51. Let me just tell you, we have been on this mission for over 2 years. It gives us an opportunity to utilize the 19 1890s African American land-grant institutions, which you are familiar with. Fort Valley is a case in Georgia. And you know the whole history of that. We were able to make sure that we had these land-grants.    You have the University of Florida, you have Florida A&M, and Prairie View in Texas, and so forth. The Presidents of these universities have come before this Committee and addressed this need. We have this bill. It is House Resolution 51. What it does is this. It will allow us to utilize these 19 1890s to address this issue and get our younger generation into farming, into agriculture. And more than that, agriculture is new farming, it is far beyond the mule and the plough from past; agriculture is a very sophisticated, technology-driven, science-driven engineering. These African American institutions have curricula applied to address what we refer to as STEM; science, technology, education, and math, at these.    What we want to do with this bill is to change some language in the farm bill which would, one, right now these universities can only spend the money we give them in education, research, and extension. But we want to change and add a fourth area that they could spend it in, which would be student scholarships. We have also set aside and we are working with the CCC, which is the Commodities Credit Corporation, to make sure we have the sufficient funds available. We are offering $1 million for each of the 5 years, for each of the 19 schools. That comes to $95 million. It is something that these universities who have been there in the fire, and have helped to find young people a way out of no options. And we have not exactly been efficient in applying funding, but this would be the area to do it.    I want you to know that this is a bipartisan bill. We have Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, as the sponsor on the Republican side, myself, several on this Committee; Ms. Fudge, Mr. Lawson, Ms. Adams, another Republican, Mrs. Mia Love out of Utah.    So what I want to ask of you, and I know you have been on 4 weeks, we want to make sure, we sent the bill to your staff, and certainly we want you to really get familiar with it and help us get this bill through our Committee here where it is now, onto the floor and to the Senate, and to the White House. We have been in touch with the White House. We are working with the Senior Legislative Director there, Marc Short. Marc is very familiar with it, and our Blue Dog Democratic meeting he and I talked about it. And President Trump is interested in this type of effort. And, of course, when you read it, if they haven't already informed you, the administration of this particular bill will be through the Department of Agriculture.    So we appreciate you. We can't get it done without your help here. And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?

11420722056	101	"Well, Congressman, again, I'm not going to further explain the Director's comments, as he has, I believe, explained them.    But I will say, when people have asked--and I understand your question to be the meaning of ``gross negligence""--one always, as you know, refer to the statute itself, relevant cases, and then, of course, it is a very fact-specific inquiry.    And since to go further would go into the facts of this case, I'm not able to go further at this time."	Let me go back to what Mr. Sensenbrenner referred to. I think it's one of the great mysteries of this case, and that's why extreme carelessness--apparently not in his mind, and you accepted it, so I guess apparently not in your mind--did not constitute gross negligence.    Now, I'm an attorney. I practiced 16 years before coming here. And I've been on this Committee for 20 years now, so even though I'm not actually practicing law right now, I've been doing this type of thing for a long time. And I, for the life of me, don't know what the difference between ``extreme carelessness'' and ``gross negligence'' is. He said he found one but apparently not the other.

Well, I think we should, and I think, Mr. Chairman, we should make that request formal in terms of our committee, if not for the whole membership of the House.    Yesterday, I had a hearing here in our Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia. And as part of that hearing, we dealt with the historic 70-year alliance that we had with Europe, one of the most successful alliances in modern history, if not the history of Europe itself.    And one of the things that came across to me in a recent trip there about three and a half weeks ago was the concern with the officials there. Let me give you one example that really was difficult for me to address when I was asked. The EU officials that we met with, they used words like ``painful'' and ``hurtful,'' and they meant it sincerely, when they were talking about how they felt from actions of the United States.    And one thing they said, in particular, was that the emergency security powers that we used to assess the tariffs that were there struck them, because they asked the question, ``You are using emergency security powers to create tariffs on our closest allies.'' And they were asking us--and maybe you could help us with this--when did they become a security risk to the United States?

11531349037	1100	Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. You are right that every quarter each participant in the FOMC submits a projection of what they feel is going to happen in the economy and also their projection for appropriate monetary policy. At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018.    Now, we will submit another projection, all of us, in 3 weeks. But since then, what we have seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy. We have seen continuing strength in the labor market. We have seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target.    We have also seen continued strength around the globe. We have seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate pass as we go into the March meeting, and I wouldn't want to prejudge that.	Thank you.    Chairman Powell, the Fed's median projection is for three interest rate increases in 2018. What would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year?

11531349067	1001	I think I will follow the path of my predecessors and not become a regular commentator on fiscal issues, but rather limit myself to a couple of overarching points.	I appreciate your articulating that. You have also said that raising the ceiling is only the first step. The job that must be attacked is deficit reduction and addressing the cost associated with mandatory spending.    We heard a similar thing from Chairman Greenspan, we heard that from Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Yellen. We are on an unsustainable budget path, are the remarks that Fed Chairmen have traditionally shared with us.    As I have raised with previous Chairs, I don't think the American public really understands the magnitude of the problem we are facing.

And the last thing I have is, Uruguay, Mexico, they were talking about somehow some sort of dialogue to see if they could move Maduro out.

11497630098	110000	I have not reviewed that specific IG's report. What I can tell you is that the prosecution and apprehension of individuals at the border is one to which not just the Department, but the specific U.S. attorneys in those border States devote significant time and attention. And steps are taken at the initial level to try and ensure that those who are seeking asylum are handled appropriately and that those who are coming in for other intents and purposes are handled through the immigration law system and often the criminal law system.	Let me ask you this. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General has done an analysis of--we have many people from Central America in particular who are seeking asylum. And what he reports, that there is a review called Operation Streamline that found that the Department of Justice has actually prosecuted asylum seekers for illegal entry before their asylum case is heard.    And it seems to me that while not only does that violate the requirements of international law, but it doesn't seem like an efficient use of resources. If someone gains asylum under the law, then their prosecution would not be very pertinent. And I'm wondering, have you reviewed that IG's report yet?

I have another question on a different topic. Mr. Sensenbrenner referred and you referred to the statute that says that you can't bring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. I think the Chairman in his opening remarks commented obliquely that this might be dangerous to do so, et cetera.    My question is the following: Forgetting the legalities for the moment, if Guantanamo were closed, if detainees were brought to super-max security facilities, prisons in the United States, in what conceivable way could this threaten anyone's safety? In what conceivable way could housing someone in a super-max Federal prison affect the local community, especially when you're talking about 60 or 70 people, not 7,000 people, throughout the country?

11635589139	1100	I am not sure I can do it briefly, but let me try. It is complicated space.	Thank you.    And would you trust Iran with a bone saw? In other words, earlier the question was, would you trust Saudi Arabia with a bone saw; therefore, we cannot give them nuclear weapons or engage with them at all. I think an important point to note is I would not trust Iran with a bone saw. They have quite a few bodies, frankly, on their conscience from Syria, from a lot of places.    And so, I just want to commend you and the Administration for your decision to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. I think that was a smart move. I think it sent a very strong message that it is not just about the development of nuclear weapons over a period of 10 years; it is also about behavior in the region and development of ballistic missiles. So, I just want to commend you on that.    Closer to home--actually, I want to hit Yemen real quick. The very first thing this committee did--and I hate to obsess about it and channelize on it, but it has really stuck with me--the very first thing this committee did, Mr. Secretary, in the new Congress was, basically, to take away the authority of the Administration to be involved in any way with Yemen. And I think most of the members of this committee have never had a classified briefing on what is occurring in Yemen. They have never had a briefing on the SCIF. And I think there is a perception out there that it is the United States and Saudi Arabia that are creating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.    Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?

Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?	They have never had a briefing on the SCIF. And I think there is a perception out there that it is the United States and Saudi Arabia that are creating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?	And would you trust Iran with a bone saw? In other words, earlier the question was, would you trust Saudi Arabia with a bone saw; therefore, we cannot give them nuclear weapons or engage with them at all. I think an important point to note is I would not trust Iran with a bone saw. They have quite a few bodies, frankly, on their conscience from Syria, from a lot of places. And so, I just want to commend you and the Administration for your decision to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. I think that was a smart move. I think it sent a very strong message that it is not just about the development of nuclear weapons over a period of 10 years; it is also about behavior in the region and development of ballistic missiles. So, I just want to commend you on that. Closer to home--actually, I want to hit Yemen real quick. The very first thing this committee did--and I hate to obsess about it and channelize on it, but it has really stuck with me--the very first thing this committee did, Mr. Secretary, in the new Congress was, basically, to take away the authority of the Administration to be involved in any way with Yemen. And I think most of the members of this committee have never had a classified briefing on what is occurring in Yemen. They have never had a briefing on the SCIF. And I think there is a perception out there that it is the United States and Saudi Arabia that are creating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?

11531349059	1100	Thank you. Of course when we are setting monetary policy we are focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment. In doing that, we consider many, many factors all around, the global economy, et cetera.    Fiscal policy changes can have an effect, and changes of this size can have an effect. That can be seen, of course, in the path to policy. It is very hard to say in advance what that would be, but the answer to your question is generally we take all those things into account.	Chairman Powell, welcome. As the Chair of our committee points out, you are required to be independent and accountable. You are also required to be tall and short.    Your opening statement mentions great exports. But you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by $60 billion in the last year. I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit. That is why the country elected Donald Trump President.    Now, the Chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017. He is right. We had Obama's fiscal policies, Obama's tax policies, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, Janet Yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet, and we had a great year.    As a matter of fact, we have been on a roll since 2011. We were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we would have a labor shortage and higher wages. We were going well, and so instead of continuing to be on a roll, we have abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy, throwing away the budget caps, $1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill.    But I think that we will still do well because our scientists, our entrepreneurs, and our workers are the best in the world, and they will make up for all the mistakes we are making here in Washington.    I see behind you, sir, the green shirts that call for full employment. It is not enough to go with the economists' definition of full employment, say 4 percent. We need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor.    That is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for 2 percent, but 2-1/2 percent inflation. That is the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now.    Now, when we talk about some workers getting a $1,000 bonus, yes, a few have, but a family of five's share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000. What greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country than that some charlatan can say, ``Here is the deal. I will give you $1,000. It is money in your pocket, and we will just slap a $26,000 mortgage on your future.''    Now, Chairman Powell, in your confirmation hearings, you said that, I believe, that no bank is any longer too big to fail. I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail; they would pull the entire economy down. We had to bail them out with $700 billion.    I would point out that the Wall Street prices into the value of the banks' stock, but more importantly, to the value of their unsecured debt, an implicit Federal guarantee, an assumption that they will be bailed out.    I have a number of questions for the record, but I will actually ask one for you to respond to. We have adopted these profligate fiscal policies. Huge tax cuts leading to a massive increase in the deficit number that is right behind you, then we busted the budget caps.    Is our monetary policy going to need to be more restrictive this year than it would have been had we not adopted these profligate fiscal and tax policies?

11525545059	110000	Okay. Those are three important issues, and I would be happy to address all of them, if you don't mind. Again, from an RD perspective, I welcome the accountability. I am an outcome kind of guy. As I understand the current organizational chart, the Under Secretaries report to the Deputy Secretary, and I view the RD portion of this, particularly in limited resources, possibly with an infrastructure program from the Administration and you all. I am not a micromanager but I am a hands-on manager, and this is an area that Secretary Vilsack and I had wonderful conversations about how the potential of USDA has been used across the country in rural communities, both in water systems, both in utilities, and both in community facilities. This is something I guess I jealously wanted to be a part of. When I say elevated, I mean elevated to a portion where that person is going to be sitting close to me, with walk-in privileges over, this is a great opportunity, this is the deal, what do you think about, how can we do better to do that.    I welcome your oversight in the RD portion. The mission is not going to diminish whatsoever. The distribution network that has been developed out here with great people all over the country is not going to be diminished at all. The people in RD are going to report to this Assistant Secretary, who will have direct access to the Secretary, and I consider that an elevation. You can think about it as a nomenclature, but there was in no way a diminishment. If you gave me the opportunity in a corporation to have direct access to the CEO on walk-in privileges over ideas versus a title of a VP, give me that direct access anytime. That is the influence, that is the power, the access. That is the way I view the RD, and I look forward to your accountability in that.    NRCS' mission is not going to change, people aren't going to change. Maybe some locations might change from an economy of scale perspective, as I explained earlier. If we have disparate people and maybe two per office in different places, and we can combine there to have an economy of scale that makes a difference of service to our customers, we may consider doing that. In fact, there are actually preclusions about closing any places. If there is any combination of bringing the family into one house rather than being scattered out in a compound, then we look to have better service in that way.    Third, the advocacy and Secretary Vilsack had made a lot of progress in that. I don't see that diminishing whatsoever.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Secretary, it was really good to hear you talk about feeding the world. That is very different from the President's budget which has cut almost every single feeding program, or zeroed them out. I am hopeful that you will win.    I am as well concerned, as my Ranking Member, about Rural Development. It is indicated in the reorganization plan that there would no longer be an Under Secretary; it was going to be elevated in some way. I am not sure how that is, except because the Under Secretary reports to you now, so I am not sure what that change is really going to be. But I am concerned, and certainly we will see how it goes as we move forward because, I tell you, you have been really busy in 4 short weeks. This is a major reorganization. I am just going to be watching, as is the rest of the Committee, to see how we progress with that.    Mr. Lucas raised the issue of NRCS, which I am also concerned about. And my first question to you is should we, in the future, look forward to seeing any kind of mergers within the agency or plans to close any of our NRCS offices? And my second question relates to the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, which Congress put in place so that there would be an advocate on behalf of small, beginning, and minority farmers. Last year, the USDA elevated that office to report directly to the Secretary, to you, sir. Your proposed plan now drops it back down to reporting to the Assistant Secretary for Departmental Administration. I just want to know what your thinking was on that?

11531349031	100100	Flattening of yield curves in the past has been a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold inflation down.    That is not the situation we have now. It is very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up, as the economy strengthens. I don't see a particularly large--there is always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.	If I could point out a possible risk that is out there and have you react to it that was created by the unconventional monetary policy. Some have blamed the Fed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by producing an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates exceeded long-term rates.    At the beginning of 2011, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was almost 3 percent. But as of February of this year, that same spread has been whittled down to a mere 0.5 percent, and this is a 450 percent drop. Given a flattening yield curve, and economic conditions that you can see, call for raising the Fed funds rate, how will the Fed avoid another inverted yield curve?    Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer-term assets more quickly to counteract that flattening yield curve?

11525545011	110000	Absolutely. I think it is a reasonable request. As you know, I didn't get to the burned areas, but my first trip outside was Kansas City. I heard directly from many of those affected about that. And that is a reasonable request, certainly one that we would consider very, very seriously in a reasonable request effort, because we know that grass doesn't just necessarily grow right back on those kind of issues.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, it is indeed good to see you.    And you mentioned a moment ago on some of the burning issues, let's talk about that for a moment. I think most of my colleagues are aware that in the early part of March this year, a series of wildfires burned over 1 1/2 million acres of land in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, and the Texas Panhandle. And these fires killed thousands of head of cattle, destroyed hundreds and hundreds of miles of fence, impacted countless families, businesses, and it is hard to estimate the impact on the smaller communities.    On the 4th of April, 2017, USDA authorized emergency grazing on Conservation Reserve Program lands located in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas for 90 days. The flexibility to graze on CRP was, and is critical to the survival of many operations throughout my district. And that being said, it will take longer than 90 days to regrow the foliage, rebuild the facilities needed to maintain, contain, and care for the surviving livestock. And last week I, along with Representative Marshall on this Committee, and Representative Thornberry, sent you a letter requesting extension of the emergency grazing authorization past the current 90 day authorization.

11635589098	1001	I will have to look into it.	Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.    In particular, we have seen your Assistant Secretary of State Chris Ford say the Department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of understanding, which do not require congressional oversight or approval, rather than through a one-two-three agreement.    And we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which in normal course are made available to the public, but are, instead, being kept secret, all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.    So, can I count on you and the Administration to release these six--they are called Part 810 authorizations--by the middle of this month?

11530956039	110000	Congressman, this is an important question because I think people often ask what the difference is between surveillance and what we do. And I think that the difference is extremely clear, which is that, on Facebook, you have control over your information. The content that you share, you put there. You can take it down at any time.    The information that we collect you can choose to have us not collect. You can delete any of it. And, of course, you can leave Facebook if you want. I know of no surveillance organization that gives people the option to delete the data that they have or even know what they are collecting.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Zuckerberg, welcome.    In the 1960s, our Government, acting through the FBI and local police, maliciously tricked individuals and organizations into participating in something called COINTELPRO, which was a counterintelligence program where they tracked and shared information about civil rights activists, their political, social, civic, even religious affiliations, and I personally was a victim of COINTELPRO.    Your organization, your methodology, in my opinion, is similar. You are truncating the basic rights of the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by the wholesale invasion and manipulation of their right to privacy.

So, in 2007, we launched the platform in order to make it so that people could sign into other apps, bring some of their information and some of their friends' information to have social experiences.    This created a lot of innovative experiences, new games, companies like Zynga. There were companies that you are familiar with like Netflix and Spotify had integrations with this that allowed social experiences in their apps. But, unfortunately, there were also a number of apps that used this for abuse, to collect people's data.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here, Mr. Zuckerberg.    Two things: First of all, I want to thank Facebook. You streamlined our congressional baseball game last year. We have got the managers here. And I was told that, because of that, we raised an additional $100,000 for DC literacy and feeding kids and stuff, so that is----    The other thing is, I usually put my stuff up on the TV. I don't want to do it very much because it is my dad, and he would be mad if he went international like you are. And he has been on Facebook for a long time. He is 88. It has been good for connecting with kids and grandkids.    I just got my mother involved on an iPad and--because she can't handle a keyboard. And so--and I did this last week. So, in the swirl of activity, I still think there is a positive benefit for my parents to be engaged on this platform.

Mr. Zuckerberg, you talked about how positive and optimistic you are, and I am--I guess, I am sorry, because I am not. I don't have much faith in corporate America, and I certainly don't have much faith in their GOP allies here in Congress.    I really look at everything that this committee does, or most of what this committee does, in terms of the right to know. In other words, I always fear that people, you know, that go onto Facebook, they don't necessarily know what is happening or what is going on with their data.    And so, to the extent that we could pass legislation--which I think we need, and you said that we probably should have some legislation--I want that legislation to give people the right to know, to empower them, to, you know, provide more transparency, I guess, is the best way to put it.    So I am looking at everything through that sort of lens. So just let me ask you three quick questions, and I am going to ask you to answer yes or no because of the time.

11530242059	110000	Congresswoman, I understand your point, and it is my understanding we were in compliance with the safeguards rule and that the safeguards rule does not prevent 100 percent against data breaches.	Thank you.    Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.    So in my mind, this is the most open and shut violation of the safeguards rule that I have ever seen in the history of this country. So my question to you, Mr. Smith, is, do you believe that Equifax violated the FTC's safeguard rule?

11525545051	100100	Well, as a veterinarian, I obviously understand the benefit of vaccination, and the fact that we cannot psychologically afford even a foot-and-mouth disease scare here at all. We saw what BSE did to us, and we talked about that earlier, but I want to compliment you on how well you listened in Iowa. I was delighted to be in your district, and to move up from the cows on the farm, a very innovative family farm operation there, up to the APHIS Ames facility. I was very impressed. We talked specifically about vaccine banks there. They are a repository, along with Iowa State, a USDA facility responsible for vaccination protocols as well. I am hopeful, I look at vaccine banks as insurance, and you can't have your house burn down and take out insurance after the fact and have it pay off. You have to have vaccines and you have to have a vaccine availability ahead of the time. I look at it as a wise insurance program.	I want to start out with a retraction of a statement that I made when I first heard of your name coming forward as Secretary of Agriculture, and I will say I thought it was candidly, but I said I hope it is more than about peaches and peanuts. And you came to Iowa 11 days after confirmation, and it was absolutely clear it is much, much more than about peaches and peanuts. And I was gratified to hear many of the things that you had to say there in the heart of my district. And I just wrote down a few of them here from memory. There will be a lot of colloquialisms that will come from our new Secretary of Agriculture, and it adds a lot of flavor to our rural life. For example, I am speaking of the trade that you grow it, we will sell it. I like that bumper sticker, and I have every confidence that will be the policy coming out of the USDA.    And now, one of the other things you said is an oath is stronger even than a contract. That stuck in my mind as the piece of wisdom that a lot of us can apply to our job here every single day. And let's see, the equipment might be a little different but the people are the same. That is another thing that is true all across this country, and it is something we can keep in mind here in this Agriculture Committee. And I will leave out the full story about the cow's tail, but that made it all real, Mr. Secretary.    So I wanted to welcome you to this Agriculture Committee, and I look forward to many discussions that we will have in the future years, and they will be very productive.    One of the things on my mind though as far as an issue is concerned is the fear of foot-and-mouth disease, and it is some of the things that we have been working on for I would say a year and a half or 2 years now in my district and beyond. That is the worst calamity we can imagine as far as biosecurity situation is concerned. I have been doing some work there through Iowa State, and the request that I see across the industry is for a vaccine bank that starts out at about $150 million, and then sells off some of that vaccine and keeps always a fresh supply there. We have another way to go where we can genetically design a vaccine that is going to be cheaper and can be reproduced more quickly.    You went up the road to APHIS and I wasn't able to tag along on that stop, but I wondered if you had any fresh thoughts on FMD and what you might be able to tell this Committee on how you would approach our preparations for potential calamity?

11389598095	110000	No. I have done no investigations. I have read the IG's report that said inappropriate criteria were used to identify organizations for review. And the IG had nine recommendations, and we have accepted all of those recommendations.    I think it's important for the public to be confident that, whoever they are, they're going to be treated fairly by the IRS, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, belong to organizations of one kind or another. Wherever they show up, wherever they speak, they should understand they'll be treated fairly. If there's an issue, it's because something in their tax return; if somebody else had that issue, they would get the same response from the IRS.    I think it's critical that the public have that confidence, and we're doing everything we can to restore that confidence.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like Mr. Mica, John Koskinen, I have known you well before you came to Congress. Since coming to Congress, I have been impressed, not a little bit, by the confidence you have inspired in Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. It's as if they saved you for jobs that others couldn't do, didn't have the guts to do, or didn't have the integrity to do. You are well-known on both sides of the aisle as the government's most versatile turnaround artist. When an agency is in trouble, turn to John Koskinen.    Therefore, I begin my series of questions simply by offering you an apology. I believe you deserve one. You deserve one because of accusations designed to sacrifice the reputation of a public servant with a spotless reputation, for political advantage, without a scintilla--and I use my words advisedly--of evidence.    It's vile enough to look a man in the face and accuse him of perjury without submitting any evidence. It is much worse when all of the evidence supports the version of the facts of the man you are facing. Whether it is that the Lerner crash occurred well before this investigation began--she must be clairvoyant; whether it's been confirmed by the decriminalization lab, all the evidence is on your side, Mr. Koskinen.    And I want to point out for the record that the line of conspiracy hunting has shifted with the Lerner crash. For the longest time, the line of questioning was about one subject alone. So we've moved from one scapegoat to another. What we've just moved off of, the notion that this was all a conspiracy directed on behalf of the White House, that also without a crumb of evidence. Lacking evidence, the crash provides new fodder.    Just for the record, Mr. Koskinen, have you identified any evidence since you have been Commissioner that IRS employees before you came or now were part of a conspiracy to intentionally target the President's political enemies?

11388494151	110000	That request will get you not thousands, but probably millions of documents.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Commissioner, Chairman Issa wrote a letter to you yesterday, complaining that you were guilty of a failure to comply with the committee's demands for documents.

So even though you have already produced more than 400,000 pages to the committee, even though you have 250 employees working on producing more, he accuses you of violating your pledge and frustrating congressional oversight.

And all we did is split it into two pieces, so that supervision and enforcement was under Supervision and Enforcement, and education was actually elevated, Congresswoman, to the director's office. So we actually put them in more of a prestigious position in the office than existed beforehand.	Let me just say to you that you couldn't implement a thing unless, first of all, there was legislation that was passed to deal with what you are doing; and, second, that we have the responsibility for oversight for your implementation. So I want you to understand the relationship.    Furthermore, let me just say that the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity is something that I am very concerned about. Mr. Mulvaney, the Consumer Bureau's Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity has had many successes, including record court settlements for consumers who were illegally discriminated against in credit court mortgage and indirect lending.    You recently made changes to gut the powers and undermine the role of this critical office.

11531349065	100100	Thank you, Mr. Royce. Of course we don't do fiscal policy at the Fed, but I will accept your invitation and just say that it is very important that the Federal Government and government generally be on a sustainable fiscal path, meaning as the baby boomer generation retires, we will need to address the significant fiscal issues that are coming to us over time. I think it is important that Congress do that.    At the same time, the debt ceiling should be something that we always raise in a timely fashion. There is no other country in the world that has a separate vote over whether to pay bills that we have already agreed to incur. I think the United States has never defaulted on a principal or interest payment and never should.    I think doing so would be something I would really hate to see and could bring very significant consequences.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being with us here today. I also wanted to thank you for another effort you undertook, and that was in 2011. You spent a considerable amount of time with members of the House, trying to walk them through the debate that we had on raising the debt ceiling.    You were trying to get us focused on all the unintended consequences, which would occur if we did not raise that debt ceiling, and I very much appreciated the time, effort, and facts that you put forward.    You have a new voice now at the Fed. I assume your opinions on the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling remain. I know that in August, it looks as though the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, or have to roll over, $500 billion of debt in August.    If we are in a quasi-default situation in August, then clearly it is a real question as who would want to purchase that debt and at what cost would they purchase that debt? Clearly a premium on that, a 10 percent premium, it would be a $50 billion hit right there to the interest expense, but there is much more than that that would befall the impact on our markets and, frankly, at corporate debt.

11497630047	110000	Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    This is, indeed, an important issue. Of course, we will always be deeply indebted to those first responders and brave men and women who risked their lives to search for and recover victims, to remove debris at the site, to carry out the recovery efforts at Ground Zero at 9/11.    It certainly is an important issue to me both as Attorney General and as someone who was in New York on 9/11 and who had friends and former colleagues who were in that group of those who were on the scene and who were involved in those activities. This is, in fact, a serious issue for those who were affected by it, and I greatly appreciate your expression of compassion for those who have fallen ill.    With respect to the bill that is currently pending, certainly, on behalf of the Department of Justice, we would do all that we could to work with you to make sure if there were any questions or issues they could be addressed. And we hope that there would be none.    This is, indeed, an important issue. And, again, I think it is something that deserves, certainly, strong review, serious consideration. And please let us know how the Department can be of assistance to any of the Members as they consider this important issue.	I thank the Chairman.    And I thank the Attorney General.    Madam Attorney General, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice established and oversaw a victims' compensation fund that provided more than $7 billion to families who lost loved ones on that day.    In the years after the attacks, it became clear that thousands of first responders and survivors continued to suffer major health consequences from the attacks and their aftermath. Thousands of lawsuits were filed against contractors and others by these victims.    In 2010, Congress enacted the James Zadroga Act, which provided essential healthcare services to those in need and reopened the Victim Compensation Fund to those families whose losses became apparent after September 11, providing them an alternative to litigation. In the last 5 years, the Victim Compensation Fund has provided nearly 6,300 first responders and survivors with $1.4 billion in compensation determinations. Since we enacted the bill, I am aware of no further 9/11-related lawsuits.    Despite its current success, on September 30, 2015, Congress allowed the VCF and the World Trade Center Health Program to expire. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in the House to permanently reauthorize the Victim Compensation Fund and the World Trade Center Health Program. The bill now has the cosponsorship of 247 cosponsors, a majority of the House, including more than 50 Republicans, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 65 cosponsors.    If Congress fails to act, thousands of first responders and survivors will lose access to compensation on which they depend to support their families when they are tragically gone. The VCF is preparing to shutter its operations once it has processed existing claims. If the VCF is not fully funded and reauthorized, the first responders and survivors who have already received the notice of their compensation could actually see that amount cut by up to 50 percent.    We are literally talking about taking money out of the hands of a sick police officer. I am deeply saddened to think that is how Congress plans to remember the heroes of 9/11.    Attorney General Lynch, do you agree that this is not the proper way to honor the heroes of 9/11? Don't you think that 9/11 survivors and the firefighters and police officers who risked their own lives to save them and have suffered health consequences because of it deserve the full support of the American people and a fully funded Victim Compensation Fund?

11531349014	100100	Our current framework says that the committee would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation above or below 2 percent. We understand that inflation is going to be buffeted by various factors, and that it may not be exactly at 2 percent. It will be above; it will be below. We see it as a symmetric objective.    I would say that framework is working. The market understands it. We have been trying to get up to 2 percent. But generally speaking, inflation has been low and stable for 15 or 20 years now.	My time is starting to wind down. I would like to explore inflation targeting. In your testimony, it appears the Fed is keeping to their 2 percent inflation target. I am still trying to--I struggle with how this is commensurate with a statutory mandate for achieving price stability.    But I also saw from the FOMC minutes, the most recent minutes, that there was at least discussion about moving from the 2 percent target to a target range. At least 2 percent is a linear function. A range, obviously, is not.    I am really struggling with how is this commensurate with price stability? Some commentators are calling for a 3 percent, 4 percent target.    Two questions, number one, do we have an expectation the Fed will move from its 2 percent target? At some point, at 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent inflation targeting, have you violated your price-stability mandate?

11635589072	100001	Yes, let me try to address that. You referenced the report that the State Department did. It was amazing work by some really talented State Department officers to go out and collect that data. I think the data speaks for itself in terms of the horrific nature of what took place there.    With respect to making this legal determination, I am not prepared to provide you an answer today. Know that we are still looking at it, frankly, that I am still looking at that more specifically. My objective here is to get a really good outcome, to change this behavior, then to hold those responsible accountable. I want to make sure that we do this in a thoughtful way. I get the messaging that takes place when a Secretary of State makes these designations. I value that and it is important. But I think we would all agree the most important thing we can do is get both accountability and behavioral change, and that is what the State Department is working to do. We are still actively considering how to approach those conclusions.	Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate that.    I would like to move on at this point to Burma. A year and a half ago, the Burmese military drove the Rohingya out of the Rakhine State through a campaign of killings and rapes and burning of villages, and some of the most horrific and unspeakable crimes that we had seen on this globe in a long, long time. We all appreciated when then-Secretary Tillerson, your predecessor, dubbed these atrocities as ethnic cleansing. Now, as you know, ethnic cleansing is a powerful message, but it does not have legal weight.    And since 2017, overwhelming evidence has come out that clearly shows that the Burmese military committed crimes against humanity. Even the Department's own investigation into these atrocities came to similar conclusions. Several entities, including the House, have concluded that these crimes constitute genocide. The State Department has not made any legal pronouncement at this point beyond ethnic cleansing.    Given all the evidence available to you, could you comment today if you are ready to conclude or where you are in determining whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military did constitute at least crimes against humanity?

For the reputation of the wonderful people in the Walking Horse industry, they want the bad actors out as much as anyone does. That is what we hope to have as a regulatory protocol that will ensure how the enforcement operates in that, how that is done, best assures the public that these animals are not being treated inhumanely in order for them to perform.

11497630038	100100	Well, Mr. Congressman, I'm actually not familiar enough with Mr. Craig's analysis to comment on that. So I'm not able to comment on his views about the statute.    Certainly, with respect to the existing state of the law, the Department of Justice is committed to fully following that. And the closure of Guantanamo Bay is being carried out in compliance with that law.    And so I believe that it is the view of the Department that we would certainly observe the laws as passed by Congress and signed by the President. Only very rarely would we take the step of finding that an unconstitutional provision was something that we could not manage. We would, of course, seek to work with Congress and the Administration to resolve that issue.

11420722027	100100	Thank you, Congressman, for the opportunity to speak on these issues.    I believe that you have truly outlined the issue of the day facing our Nation. And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view.    I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement.    It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion.    I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities.    All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well. By recognizing our common humanity, our common loss, and our common goals, we can, in fact, work on this difficult problem.	Thank you.    Thank you for being here again, Attorney General, and thank you very much for your frank and candid discussion with us that is now taking place.    I'm looking for answers and views of some events that I'm going to string together and ask you to discuss as far as you can in an appropriate manner.    Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling. Video shows that he was shot while being pinned to the ground by two officers.    Outside of Minneapolis, police shot and killed Philando Castile at what should have been a routine traffic stop. He was armed, but reports suggest that he repeatedly told police that he had a valid permit for the weapon.    In Dallas, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded seven others in what appeared to be a well-planned attack--this terrible act in the middle of an otherwise peaceful protest in a city that has become a model for community-engaged policing.    And so I think you're qualified to advise us here, as both the chief law enforcement officer in the United States and the first African-American woman to hold that post.

11635589087	101000	It is something that previous Administrations and this Administration continue to review. We have to place it in the context of our larger policy, Indo-Pacific policy, even more broadly. We are trying to make sure that we get each of these steps right.    What President Trump has directed each of us to do is recognize facts on the ground, try to apply good common sense, and then, generate policies that actually get outcomes. I think for an awful long time, we have done things that made us feel good, but did not deliver. And so, with respect to this particular issue, and all the issues that surround it in Asia, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people. And so, as we consider the appropriateness of a lot of decisions on designations, on sanctions, on how the Department of Defense is going to posture, how we work with Southeastern countries, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And, Mr. Secretary, it is great to see you. We are proud of your service in this body and your current efforts.    I want to begin by applauding the President and your Department for taking steps to recognize the Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As you might recall, I wrote you a letter last year in that regard, encouraging that recognition. And I just think at this time, with Iran and their proxies, terrorist organizations, the IRGC, Hezbollah, all on the border, there is no more an important time than now to take this action. And I speak for all the people in the district that I am privileged to represent that are proud of this action, support it, and just say thank you very much.

Where she explained to the whole world that the IRS was caught with their hand in the cookie jar and they, in fact, were targeting conservative groups. That is why the followup didn't occur. So 2 days before, 2 days before the very lawyer who met with Lois Lerner in 2010 got the data base in the format they wanted, 2 days before--jump ahead 3 years later. Two days before Ms. Lerner goes public, he was meeting with Ms. Lerner again and saying followup will take place.    But the followup doesn't take place because Ms. Lerner goes public and says, you know what--targeting did, in fact, happen. She tried to put the planted question in a bar association speech, spin this in a way that blames good public servants in Cincinnati, which you know is false. And we are--and Mr. Cummings says that is no big deal that you had all this information--give me a break.    One last question I have, right, before I go to the next member.

11525545179	101000	One of the ways, what you indicated in your district, what we need to educate people on is that SNAP usage is just not in urban areas, we have a huge rural utilization of SNAP as well in those areas, and the good thing about using those fresh fruits and vegetables you all grow down there is extremely helpful. Food banks, one of the things we can do in food banks is develop a wonderful, progressive food waste program where many of these foods we ought to be ashamed as a nation over our waste of some products, while some people go hungry. Developing programs where we can coordinate with our food banks in these under-served areas with safe food waste issues, policies that make sense, and maybe removing some of the things that don't make sense, maybe one of the areas we can work on together.	I represent northwest Florida, but one of the things that is interesting, within my district, one in every four Floridians have been on SNAP at some point over the last 12 months; twice the national average. And so what level of commitment do you see that we can give to those of us in Congress that have this kind of food insecurity in our area to either enhance the SNAP program?

11531349123	101000	I think we are committed to being as transparent as we possibly can about monetary policy and about regulation. I think, if I remember what it was like back when I was an undersecretary of the Treasury in the 1990's, the Fed didn't even publish a post-meeting statement.    Now you look at the massive number of things we publish, we are much more transparent. I think we can continue on that path. We are never done with that.    In regulation, I think it is very important that we be transparent. In fact, we are working across a broad range of issues there, including, I would point out, stress testing. We have a package of transparency regulations. In general, I think it is appropriate for us to always be working on that, and it is just--	Yes, sir.

Mr. Koskinen, you are touted as a man of integrity, and I've even heard you say it about yourself on television. So I'm going to ask you to use that integrity to help me understand a few things that have become confusing to me.    Now, you said that you want to restore confidence to the Agency, and I have no question to question that. I have no basis upon which to think that that isn't your goal.    But you have to understand that this discussion of the missing emails goes right to the heart of the issue of confidence and of the issue of your ability to do that and of your integrity.    So let's start first with just some general concept of ethics, back to your integrity.    Now, you agree, as Commissioner, that you can't both be the manager of the Agency, the investigator of the Agency, judge, jury, and prosecutor of matters that are being undertaken under and by the Agency. Right?    There's inherent conflict and bias in those positions. You, by basic concepts of an ethics with integrity, can't fill all of those. Correct?	Correct?

11497630102	101000	Well, I certainly think that when it comes to the conditions in our detention centers we need to do all that we can to ensure that treatment is fair, humane, and cognizant of the individual rights of all of those who come through those systems.    I think that we have recognized certain rights for those within our borders, certain rights for citizens in varying degrees with respect to the Constitution. But barring that or even taking it into consideration, certainly I believe that all of our detention centers should be run efficiently, fairly, and humanely.	Finally, I want to mention a situation. We've had a class action complaint that's now moot because the individuals who filed the complaint have been released from detention. They're mothers who were being held in prison with their children in Karnes. And they had a demonstration and in response they were put in solitary confinement with their children. And their argument was that they have free speech rights.    Here's my question.

With the Assistant Secretary reporting directly to me, I can't believe that that would be diminished. You are going to have directors in the three areas of Rural Development, with utilities service, water, and community facilities. You will still have directors in that, with the same subagency mission areas there. My expectation is that those people will continue to report to the Assistant Secretary. If their powers or influence or ability to operate are diminished, we will just have to figure out how we resolve that.	I want to follow up on a question that Representative Bustos asked earlier. In my different roles in the State of Delaware, one of them was as state personnel director.

11525545197	101000	Certainly. I smile because with your Western Growers the other day, we were talking about produce and melons and those kind of things, and we were talking about this very issue. And I said, well, when I grew up, we were a diversified row crop farm, but he loved truck farming, he loved melons, watermelons, cantaloupes, beans, and sweet corn, but I was his labor right there handling those watermelons, so I know what it takes to harvest them, and I know that it is very, very difficult to get domestic labor to do that any longer. And it is not really a matter of taking American jobs at any cost. We had a situation in Georgia where the legislature felt like they needed to have a tough immigration bill, and it really flushed out a lot of the harvest labor that we had there in Georgia. And there was an example where the Governor said we will let probationers do this, and so they did that for a day or so, but after about half a day the guys said can we go back to prison, because they just weren't willing to do that work. We understand it.    The good news is the President understands as well. This roundtable that we had, I think he understands the contribution that immigrant labor has made to our fields and farms, in processing and other things. We know from poultry processing and other things, there is a lot of immigrant labor.    When I said a way forward, I don't know that I can elaborate on the path today, but I have specifically hired a young woman who is a lawyer from Nebraska, who worked with Farm Bureau, whose expertise is in the farm labor. And what we want to do is to give to my boss in the Administration an opportunity and to thread the needle over this issue of how we utilize immigrant labor in this nation.    I believe the heart is there, the how-to and the process right now is what we have to figure out, but I can tell you, trade, labor, regulations are job one, two, and three.	Once again, my name is Jimmy Panetta. I represent the Central Coast of California; what my colleagues know as, based on my advertising, and I will tell you, the salad bowl of the world. We have plenty of specialty crops in that area. And this point I will be so brash as to personally invite you out to the Central Coast of California so that you can reinforce your understanding of specialty crops, and also what it takes to harvest these specialty crops. And what I mean by that, and what you know and what you have heard, is labor, and that has been an issue. Obviously, California, like Georgia, experienced some droughts, especially one in the past few years, excluding this year, thankfully. But even during that drought, the number one issue for our people in agriculture, especially on the Central Coast, was immigration, was labor force. And now, based on the political atmosphere in this country, based on the changing socioeconomic atmosphere in Mexico and southern Central America, and based on Congress' failure to do anything on immigration since 1986, it is not just an issue, it is an emergency. And I tell you, every single person that I speak to in agriculture, farmer to farmworker, they will tell you that the lack of labor force is the number one most pressing issue that they are facing right now, and it is an emergency situation.    I appreciate your statement during confirmation to Senator Gillibrand when she asked if you had a commitment to making sure that producers have access to farmworkers, and your response was, ``I will commit that to you, Senator.'' And then right away today, to Representative Costa, you said, ``I will help to provide a way forward when it comes to immigration and making sure that there is labor there to help us harvest our crops.''

11635589074	101000	So, you have seen real tangible ways we have done in Ukraine, providing defensive items to the Ukrainian people. We have provided intelligence assistance. I saw that in my previous role and before I was the Secretary of State. You have seen our efforts all across the world, Ukraine and Georgia included, to push back against Russian efforts to interfere when elections are approaching, as we are in Ukraine today.    There are many elements. And I was speaking about things mostly that the State Department and the Department of Defense were involved in. There are elements all across the U.S. Government determined to help the Georgian people, who are very pro-American and share our understanding of the way that region ought to operate.	Thank you very much.    Georgia and Ukraine both face intense continued pressure from Putin. Both have territory illegally under Russian control.

11420722045	101000	Congressman, I think the issue, as is usual, doesn't really lend itself well to aphorisms and short statements. And it's my hope that the work of many on this Committee and, indeed, throughout Congress in having the discussion that has begun on this issue will continue so that we can, in fact, continue to work on the serious issues of access to firearms in our society.    Earlier this year, I did make several recommendations to the White House, which were accepted, for important ways for dealing with this issue, ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers, ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities, such as trusts.    But also, as part of that, a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the information and the issues arising out of gun violence, as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy.

11531417041	101000	I don't remember saying that, Representative Waters, but that certainly does sound like something I would have said.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Allow me to repeat for Mr. Mulvaney that you are not and, in my words, should not be construed to suggest the legitimate, lawful acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. So I look forward to the D.C. Circuit Court's swift ruling in the matter. But I will not stand idly by while President Trump's OMB director destroys the Consumer Bureau when harmed consumers need help.    Before I raise some particular questions with you, you have made quite--made it quite known this morning that you don't have to be here and that you don't have to answer questions. I don't know why you think that is so extraordinary. The previous director came here 63 times and not only answered all of our questions, but was badgered by our Chairman. So we certainly expect you to be here, and we certainly expect you to answer our questions.    Mr. Mulvaney, given that the President has wanted to do a big number on Dodd-Frank for his friends on Wall Street, it seems clear that his goals are about trying to install you at the Consumer--what his goals are about trying to install you at the Consumer Bureau.    Now, do you support the mission of the Consumer Bureau? Let's review the record. And maybe you could just answer by yes or no.

11525545065	101000	I would be happy to, friend. First of all, let me talk about research just a second because you mentioned that. And you are absolutely right, the reason our producers are so productive today in the 21st century is because of the research and the foundation that has been laid. It is not something that can be cut off and on. And the other thing is the delivery system of that basic and applied research to the field through the extension service has been the wonder of the world, and we see what difference it has made in our productivity, and will continue to need to be as we have to feed nine billion people by 2050.    That is important, but you made a great point, another thing that is just as important is the technology, because you know your producers in middle and south Georgia are using technology for better water usage, better technology for precision agriculture, for monitoring crop needs; whether it is whatever adding, and the telemetry that is needed out there is dependent on wireless technology and WiFi. The other thing sociologically, Congressman, in today's world of connectivity, it might be true in your house with Wells' age, if the water goes off that is kind of a disadvantage, if your lights go off, oh, bummer, if your heat goes off you will get a blanket, but if your WiFi goes off that is a crisis. And that is kind of what happens out there in the world today is we are not sociologically, to Congressman Scott's point, we are not going to keep these young people on the farm attracted there if they don't have the connectivity they are used to when they go to college. They are not going to come back. And it is vitally important. The good news is this is square on the radar scope of the President, as well as the FCC Chairman. I have had conversations with him. He is anxiously awaiting the infrastructure plan where we can ambitiously take rural broadband ubiquitously across the country. As you know, there are places in our home state you can't even get a cell signal.    We have a lot of challenges, but I am convinced of what you hit on, it is the modern-day road, sewer, water of the 21st century is connectivity. And I look forward to promulgating as much of that as we can across the country.	Yes. I am not sure if you would be mending fence or checking cows right now if she hadn't agreed to marry you. You probably wouldn't be here.    Great man, great family, and what you will find from Sonny Perdue is, if he can help you, he will help you, and if he tells you he is going to do something, he is going to do it, and I have always appreciated that from you.    And, Governor, just a couple of quick comments and questions maybe. I was at the USDA research station in Byron this last week. As you know, research is not something that you can simply cut on and off; it is a long-term commitment, it is a long-term investment, and that investment has to be coupled with extension for it to actually get to the fields and help the farmers and our economy. And so they brought up while I was there the hiring freeze, and certainly hope that as we go forward we are able to come out from underneath that hiring freeze, and that you have the flexibility to put the people in the most effective areas with regard to research, and that that partnership will be there with the states, I know under you for the extension to actually get that research to the field.    Your commitment to 4-H, your commitment to FFA is something that also those two organizations are extremely important to rural America, and I know that those organizations will benefit from you being in that position as well.    One of the things that has changed on the farm in the last couple of years, and is changing at an exponential rate, is the use of technology. We know that President Trump will have an infrastructure program that will be put forward. The rural broadband, as you know, we need that, quite honestly, more than we need roads and bridges in many of the counties that I represent. You know from growing up in Houston County, you have metropolitan areas and then just a few miles down the road you have areas like you grew up in, in Bonaire, and I lived in Ashburn for a long time. I tell people I live in Tifton now but I actually live in Chula, Georgia. And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package? I would appreciate your comments on that.

We, of course, as presented in our papers before the Supreme Court----	Prohibition that can be cited here.    On June 27, the Supreme Court of the United States gave your department a rather stellar rebuke in your prosecution of Governor Bob McDonnell.    Having looked at that and the basis--that, essentially, your department launched everything you had against the Republican Governor, who everyone agreed had violated no State law. They took a Federal law--and you had cited looking at statute, relevant caselaw, and history. There was no relevant caselaw to suggest that setting up a meeting constituted a crime; no history, statutory history, that suggested it was a crime.

11495063058	101000	As I mentioned, last year we did 192 transactions in sub-Saharan Africa. But let's be clear, the European Union and China far outdistance anything that America exports to that market.    That is, I believe, partly what was behind the mandate to encourage more companies to export there, to make sure they have the financing, so that we can support more jobs here at home.	I see that the ranking member has just arrived, so I am going to ask a really quick question, and then I am going to yield the balance of my time to her.    I am really excited about the American business opportunities in Africa. I have been to Africa, and have seen some of the really terrible conditions under which these people live. And then all of a sudden, I will see this big infrastructure project that the Chinese built with their resources and their people. China has been in Africa almost since the day I was born. And trust me, I am old.    Can you highlight efforts by GE and others to build infrastructure and open that market to Americans before we completely get shut out of Africa?

11525545106	101000	As indicated earlier in my testimony, I am very, very pleased with the reaction of your Tennessee State authorities in conjunction with our USDA APHIS people over the containment of the recent outbreak in south central Tennessee. I thought that was the way the system should work. There was very timely action toward depopulation and eliminating the potential spread of that disease, and it has been long enough now that if that had not been effective, we would have seen that. I think the system is working. We learned a lot from 2015, and your State of Alabama and the State of Georgia all collaborated very, very well to make sure that the High-Path AI was contained. I think we are making progress. Can we do better? We can always do better.	All right. And, Secretary, as you know, the nation's poultry industry has been reeling from devastating outbreaks of High-Path Avian Influenza the past several years, most recently which occurred in my district. A GAO report released last week highlighted that USDA has taken significant steps to respond to the crisis, but few ways to determine the effectiveness of these steps.

11531349109	101000	Let me say that the situation with LIBOR is such that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in London has said that they will no longer compel banks to submit their submissions to the LIBOR panel after the end of 4 years.    At that time, the FCA can no longer guarantee the continuation of LIBOR. Now if LIBOR were to stop being published then, there are $300 plus trillion worth of LIBOR-based contracts in the world. That has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem.    Solving it is very high priority for us and I think for financial regulators around the world. There will be costs to doing so, but they would be trivial in comparison to the failure to be ready for this change, should it be necessary.	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Chairman Powell for coming before the committee, congratulations on your confirmation. We look forward to working with you.    Chairman Powell, it is my understanding that the Fed has been actively involved in developing a potential alternative to LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate), called SOFR--the Secured Overnight Funding Rate.

11532380042	101000	Well, we can. And the constitutional rights of Americans should be protected. And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.    I know the committee has decided to put some additional restrictions on the way the act is conducted. We did not think that was lawfully required. Congress can make its own decisions, and we will continue to be able to share our thoughts about how the legislation should be crafted.	Thank you very much.    Welcome, Mr. Attorney General.    We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise? Can't we allow the intelligence community to stop terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans?

11420722033	101000	Thank you, Congressman, for the question.    Let me be clear that my decision was to accept the recommendation of the team of agents and investigators who worked on this. And these are the career attorneys as well as the dedicated investigators, including the FBI Director, who worked on this matter for over a year.    They've reviewed the facts. They followed the facts. They looked at the law. They've applied the facts to that law and came up with a unanimous recommendation----	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being with us today.    You are in charge of the Department of Justice. The buck stops with you. And I'm concerned that you keep on saying that you have deferred the authority that by law is yours to Director Comey.    Let me give an example. Mr. Comey has said that Secretary Clinton was extremely careless in her handling of highly classified, very sensitive information. Now, the criminal statute uses the word ``gross negligence.'' And I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference between ``gross negligence'' and ``extremely careless'' is unless one really wants to parse some words.    Now, secondly, the misdemeanor statute does not require intent. It's a strict liability statute, and it relates to the removal and retention of classified information. So it doesn't matter whether Secretary Clinton had the intent to do that or not; the fact is that the FBI said that she did it.    Now, I think that what Director Comey has said is that Secretary Clinton's actions essentially meet the definition for prosecution under the statute.

I don't have a schedule for--I don't expect to be returning to that decision in the near term. I would just say that our current approach seems to be working very well. It gives us control over rates, and the market seems to understand it.	Thank you, Chairman Powell.    The Chair now yields to himself for 5 minutes.

11497630036	101000	Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    What I would say on this issue certainly is, as the Administration has stated, the closure of Guantanamo Bay is something that is part of the Administration's policy, and the Department of Justice supports that, as well.    At this point in time, I believe the current state of the law is that individuals are not transferred from Guantanamo to U.S. shores. That position is reiterated by the legislation that you mention. And my understanding, as you indicated, is that I do believe the President has indicated that he would sign that.    And, certainly, it's the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard to that issue.	Thank you very much.    Madam Attorney General, welcome. We hope to be seeing you for a bit, at least for the next 14 months.    I have a question relative to the issue of the Guantanamo detainees.

11531349008	101000	In the case of mortgage-backed securities, the roll off is less predictable. Of course with treasuries, you know when they are going to mature and you can really see what that roll off is going to be. With mortgage-backed securities, roll off will depend on the level of interest rates and the level of people refinancing their mortgages.    As rates go up, refis will go down and you will see slower roll off--	The Monetary Policy Report that came out days ago shows the balance sheet roll off caps. What I am having a little trouble with is, as I look at the charts in the report, Mr. Chairman, you don't seem to have sufficient MBS (mortgage-backed security) redemptions that allow you to reach your $20 billion runoff pace.    As I read the charts, I think the expectation is by the end of the year, we are looking at a $50 billion balance sheet roll off. But as of today, I don't think you have sufficient treasuries in MBS to do that. How do you achieve it?	How do you achieve it?

Specifically to your question, however, if a small businessman or woman was also the proprietor of that company, as an individual, they would be covered by what we are doing for them going forward, offering this free lock product for life. Number two, to clarify if I may, small businesses in America are very important customers of ours.	So, Mr. Smith, as Ranking Member of the House Small Business Committee, I am concerned about the impact this historic breach will have on our country's 29 million small businesses. As you know, the availability of business credit is often inextricably tied to owner's personal credit score.    Last week, Senator Shaheen and I wrote a letter requesting information about Equifax efforts to help small business clients, but we haven't received any response.

But you cannot say what I've asked you, that no crime has been committed.    So let's go to Lois Lerner. She came before this committee and, under--while she was placed under oath, she evoked the Fifth because she indicated that she wanted to assert those rights, albeit that she did that incorrectly, because she had fear of prosecution. Let's say that again. Prosecution. Fear of criminal prosecution.    Now, you can't testify today that Lois Lerner has no need for a fear of criminal prosecution because you can't testify that Lois Lerner didn't commit a crime.    Now, here's what I'm concerned about, since you are a man who is placed before us with integrity.    If in the process of these emails being destroyed there were those in your Agency that knew that it was a possibility that a crime was committed, then they committed a crime because destruction of evidence of a crime is, in fact, a crime.

So when you hear me say that we are going to do things differently, I don't want to automatically imply that the staff was not doing a good job before I got there. In fact, my experience has been that nothing could be further from the truth. I have been very impressed with the quality of the work that the staff has been asked to do.    The question is what have they been asked to do by their leadership. And one of the things I have asked the staff to pay closer attention to, moving forward, is the cost benefit analysis. I was, quite frankly, surprised, Mr. Luetkemeyer, by the amount of qualitative cost benefit analysis that was done. In fact, my background is in numbers, economics, commerce, finance. I didn't realize you could do qualitative cost benefit analysis. I thought cost benefit analysis was supposed to be quantitative.    I have come to accept, I think, that a certain amount of qualitative analysis is part--can be a valuable part of any analysis. But we are going to do a better job on quantitative analysis.    So, to your point, we are going to take a close look at how consumers would be affected, in terms of services that would not be available to them, the impact on the markets, the impacts on availability of credit, the impacts of availability of capital, and the flow of capital to small businesses and to individuals.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that they want the truth, that they want transparency and fair oversight, yet the Democrats' witness to testify before Congress today is none other than a scorned man who is going to prison for lying to Congress.    Let that sink in. He is going to prison for lying to Congress, and he is the star witness to Congress.    If you read the sentencing report on Mr. Cohen words like ``deceptive'' and ``greedy'' are scattered throughout that report. It paints a picture of a narcissist, a bully who cannot tell the truth, whether it is about the President or about his own personal life. But today he is the majority party's star witness.    If the Democrats were after the truth, they'd have an honest person here testifying. And if they were really after the truth, they'd not restrict the questioning to just a few topics. But let's take a look at those restricted topics.    Mr. Chairman, the first topic in your limited scope that I can ask Mr. Cohen is about the President's debts. But, Mr. Chairman, didn't Mr. Cohen plead guilty to lying to banks about his personal finances? So we are asking a guy going to jail for lying about his debts to comment about the President's debts. He is the expert.    Mr. Chairman, your next couple of topics say that I can ask Mr. Cohen about the President's compliance with financial disclosures and campaign finance laws. But didn't Mr. Cohen on two occasions break campaign finance law with his own donations? So again, the majority party's star witness on the President's compliance is a guy who broke compliance laws himself.    Mr. Chairman, you graciously allow us to ask questions of Mr. Cohen on the President's dealings with the IRS and tax law. Your star witness here broke the law with regards to the IRS at least five times. He pled guilty on cheating on his taxes, lying to the IRS. He's the best witness you got?    Next up, with the permission of the chairman I get to ask Mr. Cohen about his perspective on the President's business dealings. Let me get this straight. The witness lied to multiple financial institutions to get loans to pay off other loans just to keep himself afloat, and he is going to be the expert on business practices.    Obviously, Mr. Chairman, the witness may produce documents that he suggests incriminates the President, yet he lies to banks. All of those lies were done on fraudulent documents, documents that he forged. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. Apparently he even lied about delivering his own child, which his wife had to correct the record.    Ladies and gentlemen, how on earth is this witness credible? With all the lies and deception, the self-serving fraud, it begs the question, what is the majority party doing here? No one can see this guy as credible. He will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. He is a fake witness, and his presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people see through this. I know the people back in Tennessee will.    And with that statement, sir, I have a few questions for the witness.

11531349027	101000	Thank you, Chairman Barr. It is very hard to trace through the effects of a change in tax policy into things like wage growth in the economy. But let me try.    Lower corporate taxes should lead to higher investment. The effect is not easy to estimate but you would think and the studies find that it should lead to higher investment. Higher investment should lead to higher productivity over time, and higher productivity should lead to higher wages over time.    It is very hard to put your hands on exactly how much that would be, but higher productivity, of course, is very, very welcome, and will be driven by higher investment.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, congratulations again on your confirmation. I appreciate your commitment in our conversations to transparency and your demonstration of that commitment to date to clearly communicate the Fed's monetary policy trajectory.    You have noted on numerous occasions that the remaining slack that may exist in the labor market is at least in part attributable to stagnant wage growth. In your confirmation hearing, a Senator on the Banking Committee cited a 2016 Fed research paper concluding that corporate tax cuts do not translate into higher wages.    But we have seen a wave of corporate announcements of bonuses and raises since the tax cuts were enacted. Specifically over 4 million workers and counting have received over $3 billion in bonuses and raises during the last 8 weeks. The Labor Department recently announced the largest increase in wages since the end of the recession.    Based on these numbers, is the Senator in question, and are the Fed researchers that he cites, are they wrong and have tax cuts in fact helped increase wages as your testimony indicates that wages should be increasing at a faster pace as a result of a more stimulative fiscal policy?

11530242015	101000	Well, Mr. Chairman, we were mindful of the State laws and trying to abide by all the State laws, while at the same time following the recommendation of Mandiant, making sure we had clear and accurate understanding of the breach. And as I mentioned earlier, that took weeks.    It was very difficult to retrace the footprints of these criminals, where they had been, what they had done. We had to recreate inquiries, we being Mandiant and the security team and our outside legal adviser. That took a long time.	Mr. Smith, once Equifax chose to notify the public--there are currently roughly 47-odd State breach notification laws, as you are well aware. So I know we have a patchwork.

11426003062	101000	Thank you for that question.    We have agreed with our regulators to go back to 2011. We voluntarily said last week that we will go back to 2010 and 2009. I've told our team to leave no stone unturned. And if we find a situation where a customer is harmed that goes back prior to that, we will make it right for that customer.	Well, it seems very, very suspicious that your largest sale was right after your $1.8 trillion bank was turned into a school for scoundrels.    You acknowledge that your bank fired over 5,300 people who got caught willfully defrauding your customers. And a recent lawsuit alleges that you fired even more people because they refused to willfully defraud customers. And then you blame the low-level people, you fire them. You make profits, then you dump the stock.    So I just have to say that it seems that when you found out about the fake accounts, instead of helping your customers, you first helped yourself.    So, moving right along to the next question, Mr. Stumpf, you've said that Wells Fargo is conducting a review of all accounts going back to 2009 in order to identify any scam accounts. But last week, in the Senate hearings, you were asked if you would extend the review period to before 2009, and you refused to commit to extending the review period back to even earlier.    So if you were presented with hardcore evidence that Wells was engaged in some of these practices, these illegal scams prior to 2009, would you change your mind about extending the review?

11530956098	101000	Yes, Congressman. Good question.    So we are going to start by doing an investigation internally of every single app that had access to a large amount of information before we lock down the platform. If we detect any suspicious activity at all, we are working with third-party auditors. I imagine there will have to be a number of them because there are a lot of apps, and they will conduct the audit for us.	Yes. Let me go to your announcement of audits.

11420722107	101000	Well, thank you for raising this important issue, Congressman. I think that the issue of the training that we at the Department of Justice provide for law enforcement as well as the training generated in the field is of utmost importance. And I will tell you that as I have, in fact, traveled the country on my community policing tour highlighting departments that are working on this very issue, I've seen some outstanding examples, in particular, of de-escalation training using various scenarios to start, literally, with the mindset of the officer and how they respond to certain situations.    I have also been extremely encouraged by seeing law enforcement comment on many of the recent incidents that have been captured on video and talk about how training would or would not relate to those specific incidents. And I've been incredibly heartened by the growing sense of importance this issue has taken on within law enforcement itself. We have seen a number of, as I mentioned, of very, very positive programs involving training. We have seen, as I mentioned, not just the de-escalation but also training in the issues about the definitions of excessive force, the legal standards for excessive force. I have seen programs that break that down for officers, where we have seen----	Thank you very much. Last week, we saw more disturbing videos of police shooting of African-Americans, and we saw police officers killed in Dallas. And that was dreadful. The other side has made a point, my friends, to say people should know that nobody is above the law and all people are treated equally. Unfortunately, what we have seen is that African-Americans are not treated equally when it comes to deadly force and police officers in this country. And that's a more chilling reality than anything else that's been brought up here today. People's lives have been taken. This is a great problem. Black lives matter.    Congressman Lacy Clay and I put forward a bill last year, the Police Training and Independent Review Act, H.R. 2302, to address two of the major issues that have been identified as necessary to help improve the relationship of police and citizens. The bill would withhold a portion of Federal funding unless police are trained on a range of important issues like racial and ethnic bias and cultural diversity. I know the DOJ recently announced it would train all its office agents to recognize implicit bias, so I know you are aware of the need of training.    Our bill would also withhold a portion of Federal funding, unless police shootings that result in a death or injury are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted independently. Asking a local prosecutor to investigate the same law enforcement agency they work with and provide them with witnesses is implicitly wrong. Like Caesar's wife, an individual should be a prosecutor beyond the appearance of impropriety. If a prosecutor does everything right, the action can still appear biased.    If we are serious about restoring the sense of trust that we need to have with our citizenry, we need to eliminate this conflict of interest. As I know, as you've mentioned, a key part of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing calls for independent prosecutors. Campaign Zero, gaining a lot of credibility, also has called for the passage of this act. Congressman Clay and I have seen a surge of support. We now have 77 cosponsors. It has been endorsed by an unlikely a team maybe as the NAACP and the Chicago Tribune.    Do you think that additional training for police and the use of independent prosecutors would help reduce violence between police and civilians and help restore a sense of trust in law enforcement?

11497630094	101000	And, again, thank you for that issue, because it is an important one. And as you noted, certainly it's the Department's position that as a general matter all who appear before tribunals, whether they be courts, administrative bodies, tend to have a more efficient process and a fairer process if they are represented by counsel. Certainly we have statutes and laws to that effect with regard to adults, criminal matters, and the like.    For those children, also it certainly would seem to increase efficiency of the entire process to have counsel.

11497630042	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    We fully support the Judicial Redress Act. And I actually would like to thank you and the other Members of this Committee for the important work that you've done on this issue.    As you have noted, this legislation is critical to continued law enforcement sharing of information from the U.S. and the European Union. In fact, I have been involved in discussions with ministers from the European Union on the Data Protection Act, often called the Umbrella Act, as well as the Judicial Redress Act.    It certainly is our view that this important legislation should be passed. It would provide, as you know, redress for European Union citizens should there be an unauthorized or misuse of their data here in the U.S., which is a privilege enjoyed by U.S. citizens within the European Union.    Without this, we do have a grave risk of not having the completion of the data protection or umbrella agreement. And I think, sadly, recent events have shown us the importance, the critical nature, of making sure that we have these safe and secure portals for transferring information from one law enforcement entity to another.	Okay.    Let me ask one question on an unrelated matter. As you may know, the House, last month, passed a bill called the Judicial Redress Act, which, in my opinion, is essential to enforcing an umbrella agreement to transfer law enforcement information from certain European countries to the United States and vice versa.

11497630029	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    With respect to the Department's enforcement of our various civil rights statutes, it is certainly robust and will continue to be so. While we no longer have the advantage of the preclearance provisions that were in the Voting Rights Act, we still have significant provisions of the Voting Rights Act that allow us to review actions and decisions taken, albeit after the fact, to determine whether there has been either a discriminatory intent or, as is very often the case, a discriminatory result.    We can engage in negotiation and conversations. Many times, we do that before we even move to litigation in an attempt to reason with or have a discussion with entities that are making significant changes. And often those discussions are very productive. I was pleased to see that, after discussions with Members of Congress, the State of Alabama may be making some modifications to those changes. And, certainly, those types of discussions are an efficient way to bring about change and raise these important issues.    But I will reiterate, Congressman, that the Department of Justice is committed to enforcing the civil rights laws that we do have on the books. And we are committed to a vigorous review of matters that are brought to our attention and will ensure full and fair and efficient review of those matters and take the action that is appropriate.	Thank you.    The State of Alabama's plan to close 31 driver's license offices demonstrates how one policy decision can have wide-ranging discriminatory effects. The media's picked up on this. And this will make it harder for citizens of these rural counties to vote.    And I'm just as concerned about the discriminatory economic effects of this decision, which will fall hardest on rural, poor, and African-American communities. I imagine a Black farmer driving hundreds of miles across rural Alabama to renew an expired driver's license. And, on this Committee, we know what might happen to such a young man.

11525545136	101000	Certainly, our vegetable and our produce section of agriculture, and your people in south Florida and the growers in Florida have maybe been the ones that have not benefitted as much from NAFTA as the rice or the grain, the grain producers, or even dairy in that way. It is a real challenge, but most of the challenge comes from the countercyclical culture of growth. I mean they are lower in the hemisphere than we are, and can grow things different seasonally in that way. But we have to make sure that the safety of those products is just what we insist on in our American producers as well.    And as regarding NAFTA negotiations, my hope and my advocacy will be that we don't go backward in that. But you see, that is one of the areas where we probably can improve our position vis-a-vis Mexico, with regarding fruits and vegetables.

11531349044	101000	I do think our post-crisis policies were effective. I haven't carefully studied that report yet, but let me say that what these reports try to do is they try to identify the surprise element in a particular Fed announcement and isolate that from what was already priced into the market.    Most things that happen on announcement day are already priced in. It is very hard to isolate that surprise element. This paper takes a different way of doing that, and it comes up with the answer that comes in.    Overwhelmingly, studies of the effects of asset purchase programs suggest that asset purchase programs did their job, which was to create downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through the term premium. I would say that that is very likely the case.

11525545203	101000	I will, Congressman. Again, my mantra has been sound science, fact-based, data-driven, customer-focused decisions. And that is what we hope to do. That is a balance, obviously. As you know, today, we have used science in a way that sometimes comes from an ideological perspective, and the sound science definition is in the eye of the beholder. We have to make sure at USDA we have an agenda-less investigation, and things that come out without a predetermined conclusion over our scientific discovery that help us lead. I am not smart enough to create, intuitively, programs and policies without data, without science, without facts to do that. I agree with you.    The other part about that, when you talked about the agency that promulgated that, Secretary Price and I served in the state Senate. We have already talked about some interagency working between delineating FDA's role and USDA's role in some of these areas. The good news about the President's interagency task force over rural prosperity was, we get to talk about with different people how your rules affect my people, and how my rules may affect your people in that regard. We want to collaborate in a holistic approach to government, I think like I have not seen before; that is the Secretary of the Interior, FDA, HHS, Commerce and Energy, and those working together, the EPA Administrator. I told Scott Pruitt, I said my guys are much more excited about you than they are me, those folks are interagency.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, I am so glad to see that you are now the Agriculture Secretary. And everything I have read about you was excellent, and just hearing your testimony is really reassuring to me. I have always said it should be a prerequisite that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture should have a farm background. I know you have an excellent track record in farming and agribusiness, and I am looking forward to working with you.    I represent 35 counties in Kentucky, 35 rural counties, and there are six Congressional districts in Kentucky. And when you look at the total agriculture sales in Kentucky, the overwhelming majority of those sales come from the First Congressional District of Kentucky. We have poultry, we have beef cattle, corn, wheat, horses, and a lot of tobacco. Tobacco is still a very important crop in Kentucky.    My question is, in many instances the previous Administration promulgated regs that were unachievable. For example, the FDA pushed forward a proposed rule at the very last minute that would limit NNN, I am going to say it, N-Nitrosonornicotine, in smokeless tobacco to levels lower than growers could achieve. Will you commit to use sound, scientific data in rulemaking, and work with farmers and ranchers in drafting regulations to ensure that they are realistic and practical?

11420722047	101000	Well, Congressman, in order to change that rule, it would require congressional action. The 3-day waiting period is part of congressional action that has already been voted on by Congress. And, certainly, it is a fact that, with the rise in purchases and the increased use on the NICS background system, there is ever more use of that system.    We are working to improve the NICS system to make it as efficient as possible. We've expanded the number of personnel working on those background checks. We are working also to improve the automated portion of the NICS system so that the dealers who go through the system will be able to get information more quickly and to be able to respond, either by proceeding or denying a sale or in other ways as appropriate.    So we are working within the system as it is currently structured. In order to change that, it would require congressional action.	A loophole in Federal law allows the transfer of a firearm to anybody after 3 business days, even if a background check is not complete. Last year, the FBI concluded the suspect in the shooting in Charleston was able to purchase a gun through this loophole.    Should that policy change?

11420722043	1	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed. And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?	And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?

11497630000	101000	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    With respect to that important issue, as I've indicated, the most important priority of the Department of Justice is the protection of the American people. And, certainly, national security and terrorism are one of my own top priorities and certainly an area of concern for all of us. That is certainly our main concern.    At the same time, we do have a system for allowing not just immigration but refugee entrance into the country. As the FBI Director has noted, there is a process in place that allows for significant vetting of refugees from all countries.	Thank you, General Lynch.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.    Yesterday, a video reportedly linked to ISIS was posted stating that, ``As we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington.''    Now, there is little doubt that ISIS views the United States and the West as a strategic enemy, and there is little doubt that our immigration laws, our lawful immigration laws, have been abused on a number of occasions by people intending to perpetrate harm against the United States.    Do you agree with what your own FBI Director, James Comey, told this Committee regarding the inability to adequately vet and confirm the true identity because of the lack of information, databases, law enforcement resources, intelligence resources, and military resources available to us in Syria of Syrians who have applied for refugee resettlement in the United States?

11530242003	101000	Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned in my written and oral comments, we were in communication routinely throughout the process with the FBI, but they did not necessarily dictate the flow of communication to the public.	It has not been the practice of the committee to swear in witnesses, as you know. The witness has to sign before coming here that the testimony will be truthful. That should be sufficient.    The Chair yields himself 5 minutes for questions.    Mr. Smith, I know this is your fourth appearance before Congress, but I think you know it speaks to the gravity of the situation, the number of our constituents which are impacted and, frankly, the number of committee jurisdiction lines that this crosses.    Since you have testified three other times, I will attempt to plow a little new ground. As you know, there is a lot of focus on--I guess to use your phrase--once the nature and the scope of the breach was realized, this still took approximately a month before people were notified of the breach.

11497630031	101000	Well, Mr. Congressman, I think there is a significant debate and discussion going on as to how to best save lives in that situation. And I think that all voices are necessary in that debate and discussion.    And, certainly, if Congress were to consider new laws, I'm sure this Committee would be deeply involved in discussions. And that is, of course, up to Congress as part of your purview, and the Department would be happy to work with you with regard to that.    I think that we also have to look at the root causes of the violence. As I indicated in a response to an earlier question, just last month I convened a summit on violence of several of the leaders of our major cities--police chiefs and mayors, as well as police executives. And what the Department is doing is looking for ways to identify the root causes of so much of the violence that we are seeing.    Even as violence is at historic lows nationwide, we still have some communities that struggle with this issue. In some instances, it is gun violence. In some instances, we see an increase in drug use--methamphetamines, heroin, opioids. And so we are trying to find our best ways to focus our resources there.    Just yesterday, I met with representatives from the National Conference of Mayors and had discussions on these very issues, about the differences that all communities present and the need to have a full and robust discussion about these issues.	Thank you so much.    Last question. More than 30,000 people die from gun violence in this country every year. What can this Committee, the Committee on the Judiciary, right now do that would save at least some of those lives?

11635589125	101000	Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.    As for what is going to be shared and released on conversations between the President and his foreign partners, the White House ultimately makes those decisions. And so, the inquiries would properly be lodged there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us. Thank you for your service.    March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?

11531349132	101000	I would be glad to, sir. First of all, racial discrimination in mortgage lending, in any kind of lending, is completely unacceptable. Wherever we have authority we will use it to stop that from happening and punish it when it does happen.    We have some authority here. The CFPB has quite a lot of authority in this area as well, but where we have it for the banks that we supervise, we supervise carefully and aggressively to try to find these problems and address them.	Along those lines, I want to pick up where Mr. Meeks and Mr. Capuano questioned you. I have shared with your staff a recent article from my hometown newspaper about black home buyers continuing to be denied conventional mortgage loans at a much higher rate than whites, even when controlling for income, loan amount, and neighborhood.    In the St. Louis metropolitan area, African Americans who applied for conventional mortgages are two and a half times more likely to be denied than non-Hispanic whites. That is according to 2 years of recent HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) data.    Where there is loan activity houses have a chance to sell. Where houses sell, people move in. Where people move in, restaurants, community centers, and grocery stores are built. None or very little of that is happening in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods in St. Louis or elsewhere in this country.    My question is, what can the Federal Reserve do to ensure that applicants for home mortgages are treated equally and the bad actors who steer and redline communities of color are eliminated from this process or change their policies? Can you give me any direction in that area?	Can you give me any direction in that area?

11532380037	1	Mr. Chairman, it's--I cannot answer that ``yes'' or ``no,'' because, under the policies of the Department of Justice, to announce recusal in any investigation would reveal the existence of that investigation, and the top ethics officials have advised me I should not do so.

11525545128	101000	Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well. All of that is complicated, complex, but it needs to be all of our business about that.	California is number one in medium grade. Thank you for meeting the California folks earlier this week as well too; for rice. We just need a little more help in the exports on that, getting more of that product into Japan. There was a lot of disappointment over the TPP with only opening up another 50,000 tons, which I and about seven other growers could grow that ourselves. That didn't mean a whole lot, so maybe as that comes back around, we can see a little more entry for rice as well as other exports.    Last, I would just like to hear what you think on this. We did hear a little mention of SNAP earlier. We have had a lot of hearings on that during this last year. Very comprehensive. And it keeps coming up the issue of SNAP, which is a program this Committee very strongly supports, but the way it is targeted, and there are a lot of issues with some of the products SNAP is being used for; soda and candy, and things like that, that aren't generally healthy, where the original intent was ag products that come from here. Could you just touch in general on what you feel the direction should be with SNAP, and what kind of products we should be using with that? Thank you.

11531349095	101000	I would say I think we want prosperity to be high and broadly spread. We don't actually have a lot of tools for--distributional tools.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Powell, for being here, welcome.    Some of my colleagues have talked about how we are, where we are. The economy is--clearly seems to be getting better. We all agree with that. We will disagree on why and how. I personally think that a lot of the good we are seeing today is the result of the actions we took several years ago to stabilize, secure, and improve the economy and is now working its way through the system. But I will leave that debate for another day.    I also want to associate myself with the comments made by Mr. Meeks. I would encourage you as well to keep a close eye on the CRA.    I also want to take that and I will expand it a little bit, just a little bit more. I presume that the Fed would not be interested in an economy that just worked for Wall Street and did not work for Main Street.    I assume that the Fed would not be interested in an economy that just worked for Texas and didn't work for New York. Therefore, I presume the Fed has some degree of interest not in perfect equity, but at least some equitable distribution of the benefits of a good economy.

11426003023	1000	Ranking Member Waters, I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we have always known, as in any sales organization, you're going to have to be diligent, because not every team member will do everything right every day. So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.	Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states. That sales guide reminded employees of what should have been obvious, that they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?    That manual also said that sales practices that showed ``questionable activity'' would be sent via high priority to bank executives. So it appears that you knew something in 2007, that unauthorized accounts were a big enough problem that you had to correct your employee manual.    And, as early as 2008, I have documents from court filings showing your employees were contacting your ethics hotline reporting bank fraud and complaining to managers over unauthorized accounts. And so it looks as if you certainly knew in 2008.    What's more, I have here a consent order with the Fed from 2011 that puts your company on watch for sales quotas and compensation schemes that pushed employees to break the law.

11530956005	1000	Mr. Chairman, you are right that we don't sell any data, and I would say that we do try to explain what we do as time goes on. It is a broad system. You know, every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our products, whether it is Facebook or Messenger or Instagram or WhatsApp, to put in a piece of content, whether it is a photo that they want to share or a message they want to send someone, and every time there is a control right there about who you want to share it with.    Do you want to share it publicly to broadcast it out to everyone? Do you want to share it with your friends, a specific group of people? Do you want to message it to just one person or a couple of people? That is the most important thing that we do, and I think that in the product that is quite clear.    I do think that we can do a better job of explaining how advertising works. There is a common misperception, as you say, that is just reported--often keeps on being reported--that for some reason we sell data.    I can't be clearer on this topic: We don't sell data. That is now how advertising works. And I do think we could probably be doing a clearer job explaining that, given the misperceptions that are out there.	And you have recently said that you and Facebook have not done a good job of explaining what Facebook does. And so, back in 2012 and 2013, when a lot of this scraping of user and friend data was happening, did it ever cross your mind that you should be communicating more clearly with users about how Facebook is monetizing their data?    I understand that Facebook does not sell user data, per se, in the traditional sense. But it is also just as true that Facebook's user data is probably the most valuable thing about Facebook. In fact, it may be the only truly valuable thing about Facebook.    Why wasn't explaining what Facebook does with users' data higher priority for you as a cofounder and now as CEO?

What we don't see is the buildup of leverage among households. We see the banking system and the financial system generally as being very resilient.

Clearly the wave of bonuses and raises and the announcements certainly suggest that there is upward pressure on wages as a result of these tax cuts.

11426003105	100000	At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.    In the time remaining, let's get to the securities questions. The Securities Exchange Act requires a public company to keep its disclosure in place--that's under SOX--requires the CEO and the CFO to attest to financial statements. You referred to some of that.    Are you saying that all of those quarterly reports you were filing, that the information you had in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 and 2014, none of that information was material?

11531417059	100000	Yes, sir. Regulation by enforcement is done. We are not doing it any more. I believe very firmly that financial service providers should be allowed to know what the law is before they are accused of breaking it.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Director Mulvaney, thank you again for being here. Director Cordray seemed to adopt a policy of regulation by enforcement. The director denied that when I asked him about it during one appearance before this committee, but the simple truth of the matter is that taking enforcement actions against a firm when no rule or guidance has been issued is, in actuality, regulation by enforcement. In fact, I could give you an example of the BCF fining an entity based on they were thinking about proposing a rule.    In your January memo to the staff, you suggest that the days of regulation by enforcement were coming to an end.

11495063080	100000	Thank you. For one, we apply the exact same exacting credit standards for large transactions and small, for renewable transactions or other transactions.    Renewable transactions--according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), globally the United States and other export credit agencies can extend loans as long as 18 years.    And in fact, Jim Rogers, former chairman of Duke Energy, said just recently that we need export credit agencies essentially to finance power projects, conventional and renewable, because banks will only lend for 5 to 7 years. So we provide a longer term to make sure this capital equipment can be paid off.	Again, please accept my sincerest apologies for the slander.    [laughter]    I want to talk about renewables a little bit. Since 2002, Congress has directed the Ex-Im Bank to promote the export of goods and services related to renewable energy sources.

Now, Commissioner Koskinen, last week, many Members of Congress, including our own chairman, suggested that Lois Lerner intentionally crashed her computer to destroy emails. But, last Friday, you testified about the facts. You provided Congress with evidence from 2011, contemporaneous, by the way, emails showing exactly the opposite and that this was a technological problem. Since some Members of Congress are still pushing this accusation, I want to walk through these emails.    And let me ask staff to put up the slides.    On July 19th, 2011, Lois Lerner emailed Associate Chief Information Officer at the IRS for help in recovering her hard drive. And it says, ``I'm taking advantage of your offer to try and recapture my lost personal files. My computer skills are pretty basic, so nothing fancy.

11635589012	100000	So, the first thing we did is we identified it, something previous Administrations were loath to do. I get it. We have important economic interests with China. Many American jobs depend on that. President Trump is doing his level best to set the trade relationship so that it is fair and reciprocal. So, I would describe that as the first thing the Administration did.    The second thing is we recognize this is a great power battle and we are engaged in it across the world. It is our support of ASEAN. It is identifying the threat from Chinese State-owned enterprise technology companies, sharing that with countries in the Middle East and in Europe, identifying these risks, so that Western democracies around the world will wake up to the risks and will push back.    And you mentioned One Belt One Road, in particular. We are doing our best to make sure that there are Western competitors every place there is a project that China is putting forth. We are happy to compete. If it is fair, transparent, open transaction, you know, the Chinese may win a few, but I am very confident that American businesses will do incredibly well there.    What we have seen is just the opposite. We have seen transactions that were not straight-up, that were not fair, that were designed with a national security interest, and not an economic interest for the people of their country. The State Department has shared with these countries and their people and their leadership the risks from entering into these. And frankly, I think countries throughout Asia/Southeast Asia are waking up to this concern as well.	And thank you. I think it is an historic opportunity for the region, the hemisphere. I think it will transform Venezuela, which is now a failed State. It was a prosperous nation. Now, 20 years later, it is in utter chaos. And I think it would also impact Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia. It could really transform the Western Hemisphere and be a major foreign policy victory.    On China, as I get my threat briefings, Islamist terror has always been the focus, but it seems to me that China now is becoming more the No. 1 threat in nation States. Can you tell me about the threat from China? In particular, what I am concerned about is the One Belt One Road Initiative. You know, their theft of intellectual property--they are in our medical institutions, our universities. But the One Belt One Road, they are literally overleveraging countries, and particularly in Africa, too, where they can take over these countries without a shot fired. And they are in Sri Lanka now--they have that port--and in Djibouti.    What is the Administration doing to counter the Chinese threat?	What is the Administration doing to counter the Chinese threat?

11635589010	100000	So, I am of the nature that I try not to contemplate failure too often, but we have certainly considered what the risks are associated with the efforts that we have provided to date and the efforts. Frankly, you mentioned the Lima Group, all the countries in the region now, some 50-some that have recognized the proper leader, as designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.    Look, we have seen Russia continue trying to exert influence. We know that the Cubans are providing substantial support to the Maduro regime. Allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome continued destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. It will certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos, the economic, and refugees flowing from those regions, from Venezuela to the region as well. So, there is lots of downside if the Venezuelan people's objective is not achieved.    Second, the day and week after is going to be a long process. The Maduro regime's destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months. This is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that is going to cost, I have seen estimates between $6 and $12 billion, and years to repair. So, the day after means making sure the Cuban and Russian influence are out; Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy. And the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them through this transition period.    The United States will certainly be part of it, but I am confident we will find the coalition that we have built, some 50 countries strong, that our State Department has built, will be part of that as well.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Let me first say, Mr. Secretary, that the chairman and I will be working in a bipartisan fashion to plus-up your budget. I think we need stability throughout the globe, and we look forward to working with you on that issue.    Tomorrow, the chairman and I will be traveling to the Venezuelan border in Colombia. And I have kind of a two-part question. First is I do not think failure is an option here, but what would be the consequences for the United States and the region if Maduro succeeds in Venezuela? And the second part is, if Maduro does not succeed, what would a post-Maduro reconstruction strategy look like?

11530242054	100000	Yes, Congressman. There are two thoughts there: One, the rise and the intensity and severity of cybersecurity incidents around the country and the world is running at a pace that has never been seen before. And I am convinced there is more we can do in public-private partnership to get ahead of the curve on cybersecurity, not just reacting to it.    Number two is, the more I reflect, think, and talk to experts in the area of cybersecurity, I am convinced there is an opportunity for this partnership between public and private to rethink the concept of a Social Security number, name, date of birth as being the most secure way to identify consumers in the U.S.    It is an instrument that was introduced, as you well know far better than I, back in the 1930s. I think it is time we think about a new way to identify consumers.	OK.

11389598012	100000	What is correct is that each employee is limited to basically now 6,000 emails that they can hold on their email account which is stored on the agency's server.    The reason there is a limitation is the agency does not have servers large enough to sustain the retention of all emails. A decision was made 2 years ago when people looked at that and it was determined it would cost anywhere from $10 million to $30 million to upgrade the system so that, in fact, all emails on the server would be preserved. Because of the budget constraints the agency was operating with 2 years ago, the decision was made not to proceed.	Well, what is correct?	Well, what is correct?

And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy. Because an important part of homeland security is economic security, and our economic security is falling. The stock market is closing at the lowest level in a month. The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.    I do want to make an important point, that 195 Democrats have signed a petition saying that they will vote today, they will vote in 10 minutes, to open up the government. And I feel if a vote was allowed on the floor, there would be enough like-minded Republicans that would vote, as we did on the Violence Against Women Act and other areas, jointly in a bipartisan way to open up our government.

11525545112	100000	Well, when it comes to food safety, Congressman, there is a zero tolerance policy, and that is what Americans expect, that is what we have come to benefit from, and the veterinary profession is intimately involved in that. When I graduated from veterinary school in 1971, I had volunteered for an assignment in the United States Air Force. I don't know that I realized that that would be a food safety and public health mission there. When I served in Ohio it was food safety and public health, and I learned a broad perspective of how important that was. The food safety industry and profession had not matured at that time in the 1970s, but I learned a lot about it, was trained in that area.    We have great veterinarians in our inspection services all over. And while you are correct, your veterinary school in Pennsylvania is one of the renowned ones, along with Iowa State, Kansas, and others, along with my alma mater, University of Georgia, have done a great job putting out professionals who are part of that food safety network. We have also got great career professionals in USDA under the guidance of veterinarians who are doing great work in that.    Much of the foodborne illness you see happens after that in the supply chain, delivery, in restaurants, and others, but we are committed to a zero tolerance policy to make sure that the food that Americans feed their families are safe.

11388494037	100000	Yes. The criteria for exemption under (c)(4) are complicated because it is a ``facts and circumstance'' determination. The guidance and the new training has provided more guidance to those reviewing as to what is appropriate political advocacy and what is direct political campaign intervention. It is the campaign intervention that if it becomes your primary activity, you, in fact, are not eligible to be a 501(c)(4). There obviously are complicated terms. We provided better guidance and we have also provided improved and new supervision for any determination that is going to be delayed. We also have provided clear lines of authority so if anyone needs advice or additional assistance they can get that automatically and easily.	Let's look more closely at the status of these recommendations.    The inspector general's first several recommendations begin on page 10 of his report. They propose that the IRS change its procedures for how screeners in Cincinnati classify applications. All of these recommendations are now marked as completed.

11525545000	100000	Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.	Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.    The chair reminds Members they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the order of arrival, and I appreciate Members' understanding.    And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Secretary, again, thanks for being here, and we are looking forward to working with you across the myriad of issues that we have, going forward. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I represent a lot of cotton farmers. I believe we had a very elegant fix to the issue with respect to cotton, to the STAX program, that didn't work. It should have been in the omnibus bill, but our colleagues, particularly two of them in the Senate, refused to see the wisdom of that, and for their own purposes and own benefit, didn't let that happen. Now we are left with the same wreck in cotton. I hope I can count on working with you across whatever tools that we have. Obviously, we think that cottonseed could go under the title I program, and although there could be a lot of challenges with making that happen, we would look forward to working with you either on that or other issues with respect to getting some help to offset what China and India have done to the market, that will allow our producers to compete properly.    I would like to turn now to the Trade Under Secretary that you have announced. Obviously, as authorizers of the 2014 Farm Bill, we thank you very much for seeing the wisdom of that. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you see your Under Secretary working with the other array of trade entities, whether it is the USTR, Department of Commerce, whoever that might be, and the role that that Under Secretary would play, not only in making sure the negotiations go the correct way, but also making sure that the Administration keeps a close eye on enforcement of the various trade things that we have out there.

And we increased our staff on asset monitoring in the last year by 33 percent to make sure we have even greater oversight of transactions.	Thank you so much. I just want to point out that the bill that we have introduced really addresses many of the issues that you have just raised, Mr. Jordan. Title 5, strengthening project monitoring and due diligence. Section 501, enhanced monitoring and due diligence for structured and project finance transactions. And Section 502, monitoring plans and post-approval assessment for structured project finance transactions.

He didn't like that; he thought his words were pretty good. Among those words were Americans were entitled to life, liberty. Now, here the editorial committee did not act. He said and the pursuit of happiness. But it sounds like some people would substitute for that an unfettered and unquestioned access to 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) tax exempt status.

11531349017	100000	Thank you, Ranking Member Waters. I have been involved. This is the seventh process to select a reserve bank president that I have been involved in since I joined the Fed in 2012, so I am very familiar with the way the process works.    We always insist that the search committee, which consists of the B and C directors of the Reserve Bank, hire a national search firm. We always insist--and they don't need to be pushed into this, this is something they want to do--we always insist that there is a highly diverse candidate pool and that diverse candidates are given serious consideration and every chance to become the successful participant in that process.    I can absolutely guarantee you that that will continue to be the case. We will always have diverse candidates. They will always have a fair shot.    I cannot in any individual case guarantee that there will be a diverse outcome, but I can guarantee that the process will be working in that direction.	Thank you very much.    Chairman Powell, with a permanent voting seat on the FOMC, and its role in supervising some of the largest and most complex financial institutions in the country, the president of the New York Federal Reserve has one of the most important economic policymaking roles in the Nation.    Bill Dudley will step down this year. The search for his replacement is under way. Historically, the New York Fed's close proximity to Wall Street has led to the selection of an individual with close ties to the financial sector.    In your view, how important is it that the individual chosen is a diverse candidate, with demonstrated independence from Wall Street and a strong commitment to the Fed's maximum employment mandate and regulatory responsibilities?    What steps is the board taking to ensure that candidates from diverse gender, racial, and ethnic backgrounds are given due consideration? If diverse candidates are not afforded due consideration, are you prepared to exercise your power as Chair to reject such candidates to serve as the next president of the New York Fed?    I know you have a lot on your plate, but I have to put this question to you because we have to do better about diversity, in particular at the highest levels. Not only am I looking at what is happening with the New York Fed and the possibility there, but we have to look at our own Fed, and think about how diverse is it at the top levels, management levels.

11388494039	100000	The way that worked is Interim Commissioner Danny Werfel, who I think did a great job as the interim, established a process for expedited review, and any applicant who would simply certify that they were not going to spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity could be approved immediately. And that streamlined process continues for new applicants. Forty-five or so of the existing at that time pending applicants filed that paper and were immediately reviewed and approved. Of those that are still pending, they have decided not to, in fact, sign the affidavit that they would not spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity.	On page 17 of the inspector general's report he lists another recommendation: ``Provide oversight to ensure that potential political cases, some of which have been in process for three years, are approved or denied expeditiously.'' In response, the IRS chart says that this ``As of February 21st, 2014, 112 cases in the original backlog, 85 percent, have been closed.''    Commissioner, this is good news, and I understand from your testimony today that this number has gone even higher, to 87 percent. Can you please explain how this expedited review process worked?

11530956102	100000	Yes, Congressman. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify that.    So one of the questions is, what information do we track and why about people who are not signed into Facebook? We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. For security, it is to make sure that people who are not signed into Facebook can't scrape people's public information.    You can--even when you are not signed in, you can look up the information that people have chosen to make public on their page because they wanted to share it with everyone, so there is no reason why you should have to be logged in.    But, nonetheless, we don't want someone to be able to go through and download every single public piece of information. Even if someone chose to make it public, that doesn't mean that it is good to allow someone to aggregate it. So, even if someone isn't logged in, we track certain information, like how many pages they are accessing, as a security measure.    The second thing that we do is we provide an ad network that third-party websites and apps can run in order to help them make money. And those ads, similar to what Google does and what the rest of the industry does, it is not limited to people who are just on Facebook. So, for the purposes of that, we may also collect information to make it so that those ads are more relevant and work better on those websites.    There is a control that for that second class of information or an ad targeting anyone can turn off, has complete control over it. For obvious reasons, we do not allow people to turn off the measurement that we do around security.	Clarify and have more confidence.

11525545029	100000	I would be happy to, Congressman. Again, what we see, I agree with you, I think an insurance program for our producers is a much more palatable safety net program from the public shareholder perspective than direct payments were. I thought you all made a lot of progress in 2014 in transitioning to that area of ARC, PLC, backed up with crop insurance, which put some responsibility on the producers themselves.    Now, that insurance program is not perfect, we have some things we need to readjust. There is, on cotton, for instance, the Chairman is interested in, we have a quality issue that the quality degradation is not right. We hope to adjust that.    The other thing that your producers may have, if they are on ARC, may have a county payment in one county, or might farm in both counties, and it is different and they don't quite understand those differences either as well. There is some fine tuning. Overall, the insurance program has been a great addition. We need to look at more specialty crops, how we can cover more specialty crops in that area and more. We don't want to create a program where our producers are farming for the program, and that happened in the past, and that creates some unnatural market forces that we don't want to have happen. We want a true safety net for those who are doing right, and we don't want people farming for insurance payments either, we want them farming legitimately. But the insurance ought to be utilized when there is a true revenue loss to that producer, be it be price, or be it be production, and how can we design that program.    You all had a great start, and we will look forward to working with you all as we go through the 2014 Farm Bill to make sure that the RMA program is even more effective, going forward. We know that the STAX program was not as helpful to the cotton producers as you all would have hoped, and the dairy program, certainly on some of those issues----	Yes, I hope so too. You might not remember, but about 3 years ago I was asked to make some remarks, it was the National Council of Farmer Co-ops in Hilton Head, and I remember this, after I had made my remarks you came up and introduced yourself and we had a nice little chat. And that is my only interaction so far I have had with you, and it was a good memory so I appreciate that.    I want to mention a couple of things: I want to also thank you for re-evaluating the School Lunch Program, bring some commonsense to that, and I wish somebody, and maybe it will be you, not only talk about the nutrition aspects but let's talk about exercise and activity. School-age kids can burn a lot of calories, and I don't think they are getting the activity and exercise like we used to when we were kids. It is good that we are putting, I guess we only have two percent milk, it is one percent or skim milk in the schools, and just some common sense and reasonableness. And I know my dairy producers will appreciate that in Ohio, we are a big dairy state.    Also I want to thank you too, on the regulatory side the Waters of the United States, some common sense in there, and working with Administrator Pruitt and the EPA to go back to the states, and work on a rule that addresses the Supreme Court decisions.    Also I want to ask a question, first of all, on the crop insurance. Do you have any thoughts how we can make crop insurance better and make it a more essential part of the safety net program, because as a policymaker, when I talk to non-farming public, you talk crop insurance the non-farming public can understand that better. And I would argue in a 10 year budget window, it probably isn't that much cost to the taxpayers, but it really helps in the years when we have a disaster, like a widespread drought. But on the revenue side and the weather side, can you maybe give us your thoughts of what we could do to make crop insurance even better, and it would work for the producers' aspect?

I have found them to have some of the best thoughts and best practices to share with other departments on these issues--issues like the best practices for deescalation of certain situations, issues like the best practices for maintaining a relationship with community organizations and citizens councils, issues on police safety. They've provided us valuable input in our program, such as providing bulletproof vests, body-worn cameras. They are focusing on the best ways to use these new technologies.    So, while certainly there may be anecdotal evidence there, as all have noted, there's no data to support it. And what I have seen in my travels across this country is the dedication, the commitment, and the resolve of our brave men and women in law enforcement to improving policing, to embracing the 21st-Century Task Force recommendations, and to continuing to have a dialogue that makes our country safer for all.	Thank you.    In recent weeks, there have been some suggestions, some from within your department, that our dialogue on these issues have somehow reduced the willingness of some police officers to perform their duties.    I know of no real evidence to substantiate this claim, but, in your opinion, does that conversation about civil rights and the appropriate use of force by police somehow make us less safe?

11525545069	100000	Thank you, Congressman. I did not include that because I was hoping you would ask me the question. I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken. And when the motto is, ``Do right and feed everyone,'' I view that as very, very inclusive.	Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. And I appreciated reading that your new motto at USDA is, ``Let's do right and feed everyone.'' I think we all hopefully share that goal.    I was a little surprised in your opening statement and in your written testimony I didn't see any mention of SNAP, which is the premiere anti-hunger program in this country. We have 42 million Americans who are food-insecure, who are hungry, many of them rely on this program to be able to put food on their table for themselves and their kids. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs we have. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at USDA who oversee and implement this program because it has one of the lowest error rates and fraud rates of any Federal program we have. We might want to consider lending some of those staff to the Department of Defense to oversee their defense contracting. They might get it better over there. But the bottom line is this is a good program. I worry because there is lots of talk, I have a bunch of articles that appeared in the last couple of weeks of Members of this body, and some people in the Administration, looking at SNAP as a place to basically try to find money to pay for other priorities; essentially, using it as an ATM machine, and that would be a mistake. We have heard talk of block granting SNAP, we have heard talk of putting more restrictions on the program, putting more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for people to be eligible for the program, which would be a mistake. The average amount of time that people are on this program is less than a year. And the benefit, I would argue, is inadequate. It is, on average, about $1.40 per person, per meal, which you can't buy a coffee for that nowadays.    My question to you is, and I am looking for some assurance here that; first, you are a strong defender of the program, that you are not advocating structural changes, or trying to put more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for poor people to get food, because it is a concern of a lot of people in this country.

11530242056	100000	Congressman, I can reassure you that we took a lot of time to think about the notification process. I will make one point of clarification. On the 24th, the knowledge we had surrounding the breach was still fluid. It was fluid through the 7th. In fact, it was fluid--the forensics did not conclude until Monday of this week.    The other thing I will say is that Mandiant, the cybersecurity forensic experts, recommended that we really prepare ourselves for significant increase, cyber attacks, when you went live with an announcement.    So between the 24th and the 7th, a lot of energy was spent securing wherever we could secure our facilities to give us the best protection against cyber attacks. And also, as you mentioned, Congressman, we had to standup the environment call centers, train people, staff people, pull together the product, the service offering, so a lot of work was being done over those 2 weeks.	The Chairman did a good job of discussing the notification problems with regards to this situation. Can you tell me, what do you believe is a better way to notify the individuals?

We are doing everything we can to persuade people and, again, we are willing to be shown, I am an output kind of guy, so wait and watch and see what I do.

11531349082	100000	Very much so. It is at the heart of what we are doing at the moment, which is to focus on smaller institutions and, without losing any safety and soundness, try make sure that our regulation is no more burdensome than it needs to be and then work our way up the food chain.	Thank you, Chair Hensarling.    Thank you, Chair Powell, for being here. Good to see you again.    I want to go back to something that I think was touched on when you began your testimony this morning. During your confirmation hearing, you spoke about the importance of tailoring regulations to fit the specific scope and practices of a financial institution.    I think your quote was actually, ``Even as we have worked to implement improvements to the banking system, financial system, we have also sought to tailor regulation and supervision to the size and risk profile of banks, particularly community institutions.''    I just want to make sure that your view on continuing to tailor regulations to the specific institution has remained the same. You are still committed to doing that?

11388494029	100000	Part of the process when this started, because there are literally millions of emails, was to take a look at, in agreement with the staffs of the investigating committees, take a look at 83, ultimately it was originally a smaller number, the IRS added to the custodians as it were, that is, the people sending and receiving emails, there are 83 of those that we agreed to look at. The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume. As I say, limiting the volume, you still have 700,000 pages of relevant documents. To the extent that somebody wants to look at hundreds of thousands more pages of what the search terms defined by the Congress would be termed irrelevant, at some point we are happy to provide those. We will provide those in the orderly course.    But I will tell you that our experience is it is going to be an overwhelming volume of materials. They will take us some significant time to redact taxpayer information, a significant part of which will have nothing to do with this investigation. But if that is the way the committee wants to go, we will go that way. But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents. Therefore, they suggested with us and selected with us search terms of what would be relevant: Tea Party, examinations, whatever else they picked. There are a whole series of those terms designed to limit the volume of materials.    We still have provided a lot of duplicative and probably irrelevant materials within those search terms, but we have not determined anything within those search terms. We have said if those are the terms that will help you winnow it down, we are happy to work with you. But if the committee wants to get simply large volumes of personal emails from a lot of different people, we will go through again, making sure that we redact those appropriately.

Some institution is found engaging in terrible activities, there's a headline, a fine, and yet no one seems to be held accountable. Let's face it, the fine that has been assessed to you is probably a rounding error, again, in your quarterly earnings report.    With perhaps as many as 2 million fraudulent accounts over the course of 5 years, and 5,000 dismissed employees, it's just beyond credibility that somebody up the food chain didn't either order this, condone it, or turn a blind eye to it.

11525545090	100000	Yes, in the broad answer. Specifically, on the 1,200-foot dam, we will look at that and see. I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy. If there is anything we can do, I commit to being a serious advocate for American agriculture. The logistics part is part of that, and the waterways are right at the front of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Perdue, thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with you as I represent the northwestern part of the State of Illinois.    I want to start with a quick question, I hope, and then go into something a little more in-depth. To start with, our aging locks and dam system. There is $37 billion in agriculture and food products that flow through the Illinois ports and waterways. Upgrading aging locks and dams on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers is a top priority for the growers that I represent in my region. Congress has authorized these upgrades, but the Administration has to request the funding. And what I would ask of you, if you can answer with a yes or no that would be appreciated, but can we count on you to push this Administration to invest in our water infrastructure, and specifically, will you push for 1,200-foot locks on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in the President's infrastructure plan?

11532380055	100000	I did chair that meeting.	Thank you.    Now, I want to show you an image from March 31, 2016, of a meeting of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee, which you chaired, with yourself in attendance, along with then-candidate Donald Trump and Mr. George Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos pled guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI.    The charging papers filed by Special Counsel Mueller describe the March 31 meeting, where Mr. Papadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could help arrange a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to communicate with the Russian Government on behalf of the Trump campaign and appears to have told several senior campaign officials about it.    Now, here is the problem. On October 18 of this year, you said under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, quote, ``A continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian Government did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.''    Senator Franken asked, ``You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?'', to which you responded, ``I did not, and I'm not aware of anyone else that did,'' unquote.    Now, we now know that, one, the campaign had communications with the Russians through Mr. Papadopoulos and others, and, two, you seem to have been aware of the fact at the time. So let's try and correct the earlier testimony now for the record.    ``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?	``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?

And I want to ask you, with a ``yes'' or ``no,'' following my friend from Michigan, do you want to risk the real possibility that this program will expire by insisting upon a clean reauthorization without a sunset?

11531349088	100000	Yes, I will. We think we need the leverage ratio as a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital. We think that the current calibration of the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio is not appropriate. We are looking at a recalibration that would address that exact concern.	I want to move onto another topic, but continuing the discussion on the importance of getting our regulations right to benefit Main Street and rural America.    Minnesota's 6th Congressional District, which I represent, is home to some of the finest and most productive farmers and manufacturers in the world. Many of these same individuals and businesses, who are making such a positive economic impact on my district, are inadvertently harmed by the current formulation of the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) that fails to recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin.    This bank capital rule is increasing clearance costs for farmers and manufacturers, making it more expensive for them to use the cleared derivatives market.    I hope that as you and your colleagues at the Fed review the SLR that you come to the same conclusion that a coalition of Republican and Democrat members on this committee have, that we must recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin in a revised bank capital rule.    Will you commit to working with us and our colleagues on the Ag Committee who want their constituents to have access to affordable and competitive cleared derivatives markets?

11389598067	100000	That's correct. All the emails before June----	Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I have known the Commissioner for many years, and I know him to be a good public servant. I'm a little bit baffled.    I know, John, I think that you're probably in a position of the guy at the end of the parade with the broom and shovel here and in a very difficult situation.    Let me, if I can, just take people back to the history of this, and to you, Commissioner. This targeting began sometime in March or April of 2010. In June of 2010, Chairman Issa alerted IRS and it made an inquiry. In February of 2011, Lois Lerner sent an email to IRS employees stating that the Tea Party is a very dangerous matter.    Then the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction, in June of 2011, June 3rd, Dave Camp, who you spent time with recently, sent a letter to IRS the heat--it looks like the heat really started to come on at that point.    Now, an entire administration and one of the biggest scandals in government was back during Watergate when, what, 18 minutes of tape was lost. And somehow, between June 3rd and June 13th, Lois Lerner's hard drive crashes and is gone in 10 days.    And it's not just a couple of days or 18 minutes like Rose Mary Woods had the misfortune of losing, but 27 months, is that correct, of hard drive that's lost?

11420722029	100000	Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair. That, in and of itself, will go a long way toward restoring faith and trust in the overall criminal justice system, which is also a problem often raised to my attention during my travels.    So the Department looks forward to continuing to support those important efforts.	Thank you for your response.

11525545015	100000	It is a good question. Mission has no change at all. Personnel, no change. All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.    There will be no change in the mission. We are realigning, in a closer family atmosphere where we can have a critical mass to help people better.	It is just the most amazing thing. The potential for that extension would have a tremendous impact upon my constituents.    To touch on one other point that my colleagues have talked about already, in concept, the NRCS, the FSA, and the RMA coordination could improve by being under a single mission area of farm production and conservation. And I am particularly sensitive about these issues because my district was ground zero in the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. And part of why, in the drought of the 1950s, and the drought that we went through in the early part of this decade, things were so dramatically different were all of those conservation efforts properly practiced out there, encouraged by the NRCS and the predecessors of the Soil Conservation Service. How will you ensure that that conservation mission will not be diminished in any way under this new management program, and that the voluntary incentive-based conservation, which is the way we have practiced it since the 1930s, will continue to be the highest priority of the Department?

11635589121	100000	So, I have spoken to my Russian counterpart no less than three times on the issue of Venezuela and their interference, the fact that they are undermining Venezuelan democracy. It was met with precisely what you would expect from them.    We are doing our level best to push back against the capacity of Cuba, who has had intelligence officers and security officers on the ground there today protecting Maduro. It shocks me that the Venezuelan military will tolerate these foreigners, right, coming to run their security service. As a former U.S. Army officer, it would have been embarrassing if a third country had to come in and provide security for the leadership of our country. But that is where we are today.    We are doing our level best to put sanctions in place, to put restrictions in place, and to, more importantly, build our coalition, not just in South America and Central America with the OAS and the Lima Group, but European countries from all the around the world who understand that democratic Venezuela is the only path forward and Maduro has to go before we can get there.	And I am going to give a shoutout to you because I had the opportunity to travel with you for a better part of a day. What I saw you and your team doing I thought was pretty phenomenal, because I have never seen this done before where you were traveling within the States to promote what the State Department does. You were talking to young students to get them involved in thinking about going into a career in the State Department. And I commend you and your team for doing that, because I look back when I grew up as a pretty sheltered life. I did not even think that was a realm of possibility. Again, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that.    I share the same beliefs as Mr. Sires, of my colleague, in regards to Russia, Cuba, China, and Iran, that there is maybe a destabilizing, coordinated effort underway to destabilize the Western Hemisphere. And I think you and I have talked about this, that Venezuela could be but the rubicon, because if Venezuela fails, it will show that Cuba, you know, they cannot survive because they are the ones that have been propping that up.    How do you assess that? And along with that, how should we respond to Russia's interference under the guise of support to the Maduro regime in Venezuela?

You have said like ten times now if you give us all Lois Lerner's emails, we are going to get irrelevant information. Frankly, with all due respect, we don't care what you think is irrelevant.

We want them all.

11393834114	100000	This is still an ongoing investigation, that is correct.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe that in his testimony he actually--the response to why there was a 2-month wait was that he was informed, and then for the next 2 months they were attempting to recover the lost emails from other host computers where those emails were located. So that just because you lose the emails from Ms. Lerner's hard drive, where she was the ``from'' sender, that they would exist in the ``to'' recipients. Computers never--I believe over 80 other host computers where they were looking. So that is part of the delay.    But I would like to know, also, the full extent of what was going on, as well.    Deputy General Cole, as I am sure you are aware the nature of the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS practices regarding the tax-exempt applications has been such a lengthy, lengthy discussion before various congressional committees. Despite unsubstantiated allegations that the Justice Department has prematurely closed its investigation for political reasons, Attorney General Holder has repeatedly confirmed before both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees that the Justice Department and FBI are still actively investigating this matter.    On January 29, 2014, the attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the matter, and I quote: ``is presently being investigated. Into the use of being done, an analysis is being conducted.''    Several months later, in April--on April 8 of 2014--the Attorney General further testified before the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed that the department's investigation was still an ongoing matter that the Justice Department is actively pursuing.    Deputy Attorney General Cole, can your please confirm that the department is still actively investigating IRS practices surrounding tax-exempt applications?

11420722064	100000	Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.

11532380153	100000	Well, the President--President Obama--indicated multiple times that he felt that DACA--he didn't have the power to do DACA in the way it was done. And eventually they must have changed their mind and executed this policy to take persons who were in the country unlawfully and to give them lawful status, work permits, and even participation in Social Security.    So I felt, for some time, that that was not proper. A Federal district court in Texas so held, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals also so held that it was unlawful. So what happened was, we helped work on the research, but the Department of Homeland Security withdrew the policy because it was not defensible, in my view.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Sessions, for your testimony here today and your service to our county over the years that you have been front and center.    A number of things I wanted to discuss.

11525545003	100000	It is wise, obviously. Sometimes, I guess, the saying we have in Georgia, ``When the mule is out the gate, it is too late to close the gate.'' You don't get that opportunity after an outbreak has occurred. You all are wise in considering a vaccine bank, whether it is foot-and-mouth disease, whether it is High-Path Avian Influenza.    I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Secretary, I want to let you know, and I think you know this, that I very strongly support the Chairman and the cotton industry, and finding a fix for them, and so whatever you can do to help, I will be there to help as well.    The Rural Development issue has caused some consternation here and there, but I take you at your word that you are going to continue to make that a priority, you are the Secretary, you decide how the Department should be run. And the only thing I would say is we are going to watch to make sure that Rural Development gets the same kind of emphasis that it always has. And you have said that, and I expect that will happen.    And another issue that I hope you and Secretary Ross, and I think you will, keep the Mexicans' feet to the fire on the sugar issue and try to get that resolved. So far you have been doing a great job with that.    One of the things that I went through here recently, we had a High-Path AI outbreak in my district, and the Department did a great job responding to it, and the state and everybody. I have had a firsthand look at this, and it is clear that the time to start a conversation with our trade partners regarding the use of vaccines to minimize the impact of High-Path AI doesn't need to happen during the course of the outbreak. It seems like what we do, but it needs to happen at a different time. That is when the trade impacts are the most damaging.

11531349140	100000	Thank you, Mr. Lucas. What we are doing right now is we are taking a careful look at the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. I think our view is that the leverage ratio is a very important requirement for banks, but it should be a backstop. It should be a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital.    I think that the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio that we put into place in, I guess 2013 in that range, went a little too far. It unfortunately seems to be deterring some low-risk wholesale-type activities that we really want financial institutions to engage in. One of those is client clearing, and particularly not counting margin.    But I think our way of addressing that is going to be, I think, to lower the calibration of the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio. That does seem to get done what needs doing there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, I thank you for being here. Before I ask a general question and a broader question, I do note that I think you are my fourth Chairman to be able to visit within this environment since I have been a member of this committee.    I would like to discuss an issue with you today that you and I have already discussed. My good colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Luetkemeyer has a bill regarding, and that is the supplemental leverage ratio clearing margin.    I know that Blaine's bill has strong bipartisan support from members of this committee and the Ag Committee. In essence, it would offset those margin amounts for purposes of SLR because margin is inherently a risk management tool and legally must be kept separate from a bank's own funds.    The Fed can effect this change without legislation, however, and your predecessor showed a willingness to look at the issue. I was hoping you might be willing to consider that situation, that sort of a fix yourself?	I was hoping you might be willing to consider that situation, that sort of a fix yourself?

11531349053	100000	I do. I think cybersecurity overall is one of the really significant threats and we can never feel like we have done enough to deal with it. We have tried to harmonize through the FFIEC process, our supervisory guidance on what we expect from firms on cybersecurity issues and data safety and that kind of thing. I am sure we can do a better job, and we are committed to trying.	I look forward to working with you on that, because I told the bankers when I left them, if you see a problem, let me know, because I have a chance to talk to Mr. Powell myself here this morning, so we will carry the message. Thank you for that.    With regards to data security and cybersecurity, this is an issue that we are working on right now. My committee, my subcommittee, has a bill that we are putting together. Data security, cybersecurity threats have the potential to wreck our economy, to wreak havoc with it. We subject financial companies to an absurd maze of cybersecurity regulations.    The Federal Reserve is one of the many entities that examines for cybersecurity. There is zero harmonization between the agencies. The result is that financial firms spend thousands of hours complying with regulations, rather than actually protecting their systems and their customers. Do you see this as a problem?

That report, pursuant to British law, shows that women at Barclays earn 26 percent less than men and receive bonuses that are 60 percent lower than men.    Now, I know that some of those reasons might be reasons as to who owns which position. But it certainly goes toward the idea of equitable distribution of the benefits of the economy.

11525545055	100000	Again, any valid insurance program, whether it is crop insurance or any other insurance program, has to reflect the reality of risk there. That is what insurance is all about. As I said, as we continue to perfect the insurance program, because I agree with you, and as you well know, credit in these economic times is getting more tight, lenders are requiring an insurance product, maybe forward contracting as well, so that the producers can demonstrate repayment ability. And as we go through there, yes, I agree that it ought to be commensurate with risk. That is a tough issue, how do we do that individually, or by county or by region, in a way to do that. That is why reporting is so important for our farmers. The Census is so important for our farmers and producers to make sure we have accurate data that we can make good, wise actuarial decisions on.	Yes, I will go with that.    Let me shift subjects just a little bit, there has been a little discussion here on crop insurance, and I want the record to show that I absolutely support crop insurance. It is the essential component for risk management. And if we don't have crop insurance, we lose perhaps generations, especially young farmers. And so it is essential to keep our family farms on the farm, the ones we have left.    I will just ask the question this way.

For example, the New York Fed has done extensive outreach to community groups and of that nature, universities and all sorts of things around the New York region and around the Nation.    In addition, the national search firms have a very large presence in the candidate population and know who is out there, know who would be a good candidate. They are always trying to find new candidates, and we are too.    It is something we work very hard at and are always interested in having new ideas for qualified candidates as well. We invite the general public generally to offer their thoughts, as well as some of the interest groups.	I appreciate that. I am sure that you are committed to that. But the diverse candidate question is a question that many of us have, and we don't know that there has been consideration for diverse candidates with these very, very important positions. I am wondering where do the recommendations come from? How is the outreach done and how can you ensure that there are diverse candidates to be considered?

11635589079	100000	So, you asked three questions there, I believe. The first one was what was my knowledge base. I think at that time I knew most of what had taken place, although I do not recall the exact sequence. I certainly have learned more about that since then. I have learned additional facts since that moment in time.    The second question was did I discuss the murder. The answer is yes. I think I said it that day, that I had discussed the murder with him.    And then, the third question is how will we hold them accountable. You have seen the Trump Administration do just that with respect to 17 individuals. We are continuing all across the government, certainly with overt means and all the tools that we have in our capacity, to learn more facts about this. President Trump has made very clear that we will continue to work to identify those who are responsible for Jamal Khashoggi's murder and hold them accountable. We will. I stand by that today. I am sure President Trump will as well.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome back, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for being here.    Mr. Secretary, I do not want to talk at a political level today with you. I want to talk from the heart. And I want to talk about a matter of justice on behalf of one of my constituents well known to you. I want to show you a picture.    This picture took place on November 19th, 2017 in my district. I am holding a cane because I had had a bad accident at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, a few months before and I still needed a cane to hobble around, not the most flattering picture of me.    Next to me is a man named Jamal Khashoggi. He is a mild-mannered man. He and I are discussing Middle East issues. He was a Saudi citizen, family, children, had on occasion worked for the Saudi government or for members of the royal family. He was mild-mannered, soft-spoken, and a moderate critic of the Kingdom. He wanted to see modernization. He wanted to see reforms. He was a columnist sometimes for The Washington Post, our local newspaper here in Washington.    On October 2d, 2018, 11 months later, my constituent, a legal resident of the United States who lived in Tysons Corner in Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia, was lured into the sovereign territory, the consulate of the Saudi government in Istanbul because he was seeking papers to get remarried. He had his fiancee outside waiting for him. He had been to the consulate before, and they had lulled him into believing he would be safe. But, of course, he was not.    What we know was that, on that day, two planes under the control of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia flew in with two teams whose objective was to either kidnap or kill Mr. Khashoggi. One presumes the objective involved killing because, not a diplomatic tool normally, they brought with them a bone saw. We know all of that because of revelations from Turkey. But those revelations, as I understand it, have been confirmed by our intelligence community; you would know better than I.    Nonetheless, what we do know is the Saudi government lied consistently. They lied about whether he safely left the consulate that day, knowing full well he did not. They lied about his murder. They lied about the conspiracy to murder him. They lied about who did it and how it was done.    And I guess I want to show you another picture, Mr. Secretary. This is a picture that took place 14 days after the murder. And that shows you and the Crown Prince, who many believe orchestrated and ordered the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, my constituent. And I guess what this picture raises is a question. At what point, as Americans, do we insist that the inalienable rights enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, all three of which were denied my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi, when do they trump diplomatic nicety? Is there ever a time when we are going to, as a country, insist, you know what, we are not going to do business as normal and we are going to hold you to account?    Now, at that meeting, you said, I believe, that they would be held to account, but you were meeting with a man who was assuring you they would be held to account, when he is himself suspected strongly of having orchestrated the murder. And so, I guess I want to ask you, Mr. Secretary, were you aware of the fact at that point of the gruesome details of the murder of my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi? Did you discuss that murder with the Crown Prince? And how are we going, moving forward, to hold the Crown Prince and the Saudi government responsible for one of the most grisly episodes ever to occur in a consulate or an embassy in our diplomatic experience?

11635589127	1000	Look, I am proud of what this Administration has done in Iraq. I think we have been prepared to do things, take risks, act against Iran, the true malign actor inside of Iraq today, in ways the previous Administration just had no interest in whatsoever. So, I am very proud of the work we have done there.    I have traveled now to Baghdad as the Secretary. I had been there before in my previous role. I have senior officials on the ground. I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign. I think that is your goal. It is certainly mine.	And we have. And you are the Secretary of State before us.

And I would urge you to have hearings where we hear from the CEOs of Bank of America, Citigroup, and others.    And, until then, I hope that you would join with me in a letter of inquiry to ask what new account-opening quotas they had for their bank tellers, how many people they fired for not meeting their quotas, or how many people they fired for opening phony accounts.    We have Wells Fargo before me, but I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience. Your colleagues should at least come forward with some assurance.    We are now engaged in an important national ritual where the CEO comes before the Representatives of the American people to apologize, to take full responsibility, to do so humbly.

11497630025	100000	Thank you, Congressman Conyers.    This is, in fact, one of my top priorities as Attorney General. And I'm incredibly proud to say that the Department of Justice has already begun the type of outreach that I was discussing at that particular event.    Through our COPS Office, in particular, the Community-Oriented Policing Service Office, we reach out directly to police departments across the country and offer technical assistance, we offer training, we offer peer-to-peer support.    We have found that an incredibly effective way to share information within the law enforcement community is peer-to-peer, police-officer-to-police-officer, chief-to-chief. And so we work with the departments that have, in fact, made great strides in the area of police-community relations and seek to match them up with other departments who are having challenges in this area and who would be receptive to their input.    I also, as I noted in my opening statement, have been on a six-city community policing tour. And as I talk with residents, with young people, elected leaders, I also talk with police officers. I do meet with chiefs and supervisors, but I also talk to the rank-and-file, the officers who are on the beats of our cities, to get their ideas as to what has worked in their city, as to why a positive relationship has developed in the cities where they have had challenges and where they have had struggles.    I have listened to their stories of commitment and dedication and to their embrace of community policing and concern for residents as a program and policy that makes policing more efficient and that makes communities safer. And I'm incredibly proud to support those efforts.	Thank you very much, Chairman Goodlatte.    Attorney General Lynch, I want to thank you again for speaking at my panel at this year's Congressional Black Caucus Legislative Forum. It was marvelous.    At that event, you spoke about the breakdown in trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. You also spoke about getting to the root of the problem with a comprehensive approach to training, to policy, and to research.    Many of the law enforcement officers in attendance agreed with your comments. How are you planning on reaching out to the broader law enforcement community to promote these ideas?

11635589003	1000	I do not want to speak about particular troop levels. I will leave that to the Department of Defense. But I can talk about the policy. The President has made clear he wants to put as few American soldiers' lives at risk as he possibly can and do so while achieving America's important policy interests. I think we can do that.    By the way, I have a senior State Department official who is working diligently to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 and to work with the Turks and with the Kurds to create conditions on the ground, in the real estate that separates Syria and Turkey, so that we can continue to maintain the vigilance that led to the destruction of the caliphate.    It is a longer answer, but this fits inside our policy throughout the Middle East, whether it is Iraq or in Syria, the work that we are doing to help Lebanon, the work we are doing with our Gulf partners to achieve precisely what it is I think you describe, a secure situation for the American people and an increase in the stability throughout the Middle East.	I just want you to know that I have here the OIG's email confirming that they have no problems with the Department providing these documents to Congress. It has just been very frustrating, and I am sure you can understand, the stonewalling we have been getting for over a year now. And it is very frustrating. All we want to know is what we are entitled to know. A call from your staff just days before this hearing in which they did not agree to produce any documents is really not a good-faith effort. So, I would hope, based on what you have said, that you will provide us the documents the committee requested, and I hope you can do that within 1 week. There is nothing outlandish or outrageous. We are just trying to do our jobs.    I want to ask you a question about Syria. I am very worried about President Trump's statement that we are going to pull out of Syria. I do not want the United States to be in a foreign country any more than we have to, but pulling out of Syria would be a betrayal to the Kurds, our faithful allies for many, many years; saved American lives. It would create problems for our ally Israel because it would put the Iranian regime right on Israel's border. And if and when we ever had to come back, it would probably result in more American casualties. Right now, we seem to have the situation pretty much in hand.    So, I hope that the President's precipitous statement that we were going to, after he allegedly spoke with Mr. Erdogan of Turkey, that we were going to pull out of Syria soon, immediately, or whatever, is not the truth, is not so, and that we have rethought it. And can you give us some assurances on that?	And can you give us some assurances on that?

11420722000	100000	Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.    As I've said on several occasions before, when the referral came into the Department of Justice, it was received and referred to experienced, dedicated career agents and prosecutors who handle matters of this type every day with independence, with efficiency, with thoroughness, and the matter was handled like any other matter.    It was reviewed through the chain by those independent career agents and prosecutors. And, in considering the matter, there was no connection, there was no need for recusal or an independent prosecutor.	Thank you, General Lynch.    We'll now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.    Before being confirmed as Attorney General in May of last year, you were first nominated by President Obama to serve as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and you were originally appointed to the U.S. Attorney post in 1999 by former President Bill Clinton.    The existence of Secretary Clinton's private email server was first brought to light in March of last year, 1 month before your confirmation as Attorney General. A few months after your confirmation, the inspectors general of State and National Intelligence requested the Department of Justice investigate whether classified information was stored on her private email servers. The FBI then opened an investigation into the matter.    Given that she was a political appointee of your current boss and, more importantly, the wife of your previous boss, why did you not see fit to recuse yourself from the investigation? Wouldn't recusal or appointment of a special prosecutor have removed any appearance of impropriety given your service during Bill Clinton's Presidency?

11388494076	100000	No. I think what has happened is the subpoena that was delivered to me in February said it wanted all the emails for a set of people. What we have been trying to do is all of those people, you have emails from those people with regard to the determination process pursuant to the search terms that we have been working with. The subpoena now says we would like them all for anything. We have now finally completed, although we are still working on the redaction, all of the production of documents regarding the determination process, which is what the IG report focused on. We have said that that is the first priority we have had. We have never said we are not going to provide you the rest of the documents, and in fact, trying to figure out the most efficient way to do it, we have said we will provide you Lois Lerner emails on everything with regard to examinations, appeals, and the regulatory process as it goes forward.    And I have said when we are done with all of that, if you want to actually get emails, if you want them all, we will give them all to you, but if you want to actually take a more focused investigation on the regulatory process or otherwise, we are happy to work with you to figure how that goes. But in light of this chairman's view, as soon as we can finish the rest of these redactions and go forward, we will provide you volumes of emails, which many of them are going to be irrelevant, which is what I said in Congressman Mica's comment. Not that the materials you have are irrelevant; the ones you are likely to get in volume are irrelevant. And if you want it without any selective process, we will redact them. There are going to be thousands of pages and we are happy to provide them to you, but it is not going to expedite the conclusion of this investigation and, as I say, a significant part of it is going to be irrelevant.

11426003033	1000	Thank you, Congressman, for that question.    In our company, we have 14 outside directors. We have a lead director. All directors are New York Stock Exchange-independent, by their standards. I am not a member of any standing committee of that board. The independent directors and the lead director help set the agenda for the boards. They always have meetings that are in executive session without me.    And as you probably read about what happened this weekend--because we filed an 8-K yesterday about actions that they took as an independent board, and I was not part of that. So the board acts quite independently.

11525545077	100000	Congressman, I agree with you. You know that those contracts are set and it can't be changed for this incident, this tragedy that just happened, but the RMA has learned from that, and certainly on some of these dates on practical replant, makes a huge difference for guarding yield production, the quality of seed, the hybrid seed, and other things, the chemicals that are linked with that. You will see, and I will commit to you that you will see some changes in the RMA practical dates, going forward, for the 2018 contract.	It has been just a couple of weeks since we toured some of the devastation in my district. Let me thank you for your responsiveness, your Department's responsiveness, and your personal attention on that issue. I think our 100 year floods are coming a little more frequently than every 100 years. This is our third in 6 years, you saw that yourself. And I guess, as I mentioned before, and has been talked about here, crop insurance is an important component, no question about it, but as it applies to rice the practical to replant provision there has really added more confusion than clarity. And so I am hoping that you can, and I am certain that you will work with us on actually trying to provide some flexibility on that because, as you know, after May 15 it is strictly not practical to replant rice and expect a yield, so having some alternative would be much appreciated?

On the 9th of March, following the standard protocol, the communication was disseminated to those who needed to know about the patch.    Two things happened, Mr. Chairman: One was a human error, an individual who was responsible for what we call the patching process did not ensure that there was communication and closed-loop communication to the person who needed to apply the patch. That was error number one.    Error number two was on the 15th of March, we used a technology called a scanning technology, which looks around the systems for vulnerabilities. That scanner, for some reason, did not detect the Apache vulnerability. So we had a human error, as I alluded to in my oral testimony, and a technological error, both resulting in the fact that it was not patched.	So what happened?	So what happened?

11635589016	100000	Yes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary of State, thank you and welcome.    I want to talk a little bit about the Western Hemisphere and what is going on. I see a bigger plan in what is going on in Venezuela I think than most people. I see a lot of similarities of what happened with Cuba and what is happening in Venezuela. In Cuba, they allowed the people to leave that were disenchanted with the government. In Venezuela, there are 5,000 people leaving every day. They expect, by the end of this year, to be about 5 million people that have left Venezuela, those who are disenchanted with this government.    I really believe that there is a bigger plan here to destabilize the Western Hemisphere with what is going on in Venezuela. You have a million people putting a great deal of pressure on Colombia, and they have opened their doors and they have done a great job in helping these people. You have 700,000 people going into Peru. You have people all the way down to Argentina. Some of these countries cannot absorb the quantity of people that are leaving Venezuela daily. So, to me, I think this is part of a bigger plan to destabilize this whole region.    It continues to keep us busy. It continues to make America the bad apple in all this. And I would hope that we will continue to put pressure on Maduro. I do not believe in military action, but I do believe that sanctions will be effective and working with the Lima Group will be very effective.    This afternoon, I am meeting with Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Guaido. She is very concerned about her husband. She feels that any day now they are going to pick him up, and God knows where they are going to put him.    Are we prepared to increase our sanctions and make it even harder for Maduro to continue being in power if anything like this happens?

While we have the wonderful land-grant institutions that Congressman Scott talked about, we have also got some technology schools that are using great processing technology, harvest technology, and preserving technology that make a lot of sense. We are going to look at where our research dollars go. If it makes sense to have a processing, harvesting part of the whole supply chain to benefit agriculture, we will do that. Our example in Georgia, as Congressman Scott knows, is that while our primary land-grants; University of Georgia as well as Fort Valley State, Georgia Tech Engineering School does a lot of work with poultry processing, and how to make that more efficient and better.    Those are the types of things we want to look at to make sure that we use those research dollars wisely, not just maybe in the basic production or applied production sides, but how we get that product in a safe, palatable way to the consumer.

11497630008	1000	Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.    With regard to the Department of Justice enforcement of the gun laws, we take those gun laws very seriously and are committed to using the full panoply of laws and regulations on the books.    We typically use those laws at the Federal level in conjunction with our many and numerous violent crime initiatives. For example, in my former position as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, many of our gang cases also carried with them firearms charges. They would not necessarily be the lead charge, they may not be reflected in the data that you have, but they certainly are an important tool in every prosecutor's arsenal in combating violent crime.    In the discussions----	Well, I think we'll be vulnerable, too, when it comes to people from Syria, when we can't get access to those databases because the country is in disarray, and we can't even gather information, fresh, new, because we can't access the people that we could talk to.    Let me move on to another topic. The latest available data from the Justice Department shows that, during fiscal year 2015, the government reported 6,002 new weapons convictions. This number is down 5.8 percent from the previous fiscal year, when the number of convictions totaled 6,373. Compared to 5 years ago, when there were 7,101 weapons convictions, the number for fiscal year 2015 is down 15.5 percent. Convictions over the past year are lower than they were 10 years ago. Overall, the data show that convictions of this type, weapons violations, are down 34.8 percent from the level of 9,206 reported in 2005.    The President has repeatedly called for new gun control laws, yet your department has seen weapons prosecutions and convictions fall to levels not seen in over a decade.    How do you explain such a precipitous drop in weapon prosecutions and convictions under this Administration? And why is such little emphasis placed on these types of prosecutions, when the President has called for yet more laws when the current laws are not being enforced?

11525545083	100	Thank you, sir. I haven't told the Chairman yet, but our Chief Economist just said Georgia was number one in cotton.	Absolutely. I share that sentiment. The bill is written to address that very provision, that it is strictly a private transaction with no taxpayer backstop, and that is important to note.    To go back to cotton real quick. I just want to echo the concerns of the Chairman in regards to the problems that we are facing in cotton country. We are behind you by one, we are number three in cotton and Georgia is number two, and the Chairman will claim credit for Texas being number one in cotton production, but we are all in this together. And cotton producers need relief, and they need it yesterday. And, when we start to lose our gin infrastructure, as the old saying goes, ``You can cut down an oak tree in 5 minutes but it takes a long time to grow it back.'' And so as we start to see our ginning infrastructure disappear it is going to have an impact on our rural economies, and in the broader sense on our economy and state in general. I hope that, as you have indicated, and I am sure you will, use every tool at your disposal to help us address that issue of the cotton producers belt-wide?

11497630018	100000	Mr. Chairman, the Department reviews facts and evidence submitted before it. We apply the law to those facts and evidence. We take all the appropriate steps in every matter that we review. And that is how we will essentially manage every matter under our purview, whether it relates to the IRS, to an e-mail matter, or every matter that comes before us.    And with respect to the President's comments, they have no influence or bearing on how the Department manages these matters. And I would have to refer you to him for a review of those.	I want to cover one more topic that concerns me greatly.    During the FBI's investigation of the IRS matter, the President stated on Super Bowl Sunday that there was not ``even a smidgeon of corruption at the IRS.'' At the end of that investigation, no charges were filed.    Two weeks ago, the President stated with respect to Secretary Clinton's e-mails, ``This is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.''    Should we expect that when the FBI finishes its investigation of this matter that no charges will be filed?

11531349103	1000	First, again, I am not at all familiar with either the British bill or the EEOC proposed rule that was--I am not familiar with either of those. These are the things that Congress should consider. We have a job, we have a really important job to do that you have assigned us to do. For now we are going to stick to that and try to achieve--	OK, fair enough. The reason you are not familiar with it is because the Trump Administration stopped it. It was proposed in 2016. Companies were given 2 years to work their way in. But as of last August, the Trump Administration said no, we don't want to know how you pay women, how you pay people of racial groups or ethnicity groups. We don't care about that.    Now, I personally think that is horrendous and I would actually say that, again, if you are interested in an economy that has some degree of equitability you need statistics. You need numbers. Anecdotal answers are very interesting and they make for good political commentary, but they don't help us address the problems.    I would ask therefore if something like that, that is new to Britain, doesn't seem to have impacted Barclays in any particularly bad way, but provides us the information we have to go forward to argue for pay equity across the board.    Now, I am a white male, but I am not interested in my success being at the expense of people who are not white men. I would ask, is the Fed interested in all, would you be interested in pursuing something--you oversee 7,000 entities, some of them large, some of them small, most of them pretty large.
