11635589127	1000	Look, I am proud of what this Administration has done in Iraq. I think we have been prepared to do things, take risks, act against Iran, the true malign actor inside of Iraq today, in ways the previous Administration just had no interest in whatsoever. So, I am very proud of the work we have done there.    I have traveled now to Baghdad as the Secretary. I had been there before in my previous role. I have senior officials on the ground. I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign. I think that is your goal. It is certainly mine.	And we have. And you are the Secretary of State before us. And as a former Member of this body, you also understand the constitutional obligation we have to provide oversight of the Administration.    The Fiscal Year foreign affairs budget eliminates all economic assistance to the Syrian people and all security assistance, known as foreign military financing. That is to Iraq.

Where she explained to the whole world that the IRS was caught with their hand in the cookie jar and they, in fact, were targeting conservative groups. That is why the followup didn't occur.

Two days before Ms. Lerner goes public, he was meeting with Ms. Lerner again and saying followup will take place.    But the followup doesn't take place because Ms. Lerner goes public and says, you know what--targeting did, in fact, happen.

11531349037	1100	Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. You are right that every quarter each participant in the FOMC submits a projection of what they feel is going to happen in the economy and also their projection for appropriate monetary policy. At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018.    Now, we will submit another projection, all of us, in 3 weeks. But since then, what we have seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy. We have seen continuing strength in the labor market. We have seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target.    We have also seen continued strength around the globe. We have seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate pass as we go into the March meeting, and I wouldn't want to prejudge that.	Thank you.    Chairman Powell, the Fed's median projection is for three interest rate increases in 2018. What would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year?

The witness does not seem to want to answer any questions pertaining to helping the lower part America. He is quick to answer when it involves corporations or big banks. He tries adding what their responsibilities are and are not. But, this doesn't answer any part of the question. I do not believe that every senator would pose questions to Mr. Powell that was out of the scope for him to be able to answer. The witness is asked a question about something he clearly does know some about, and he says he does not. I do not believe him, and I think the reason he says what he says is to avoid saying aloud that corporate tax cuts do not benefit regular people. I think his response here is telling. Again witness answered the question partially based on the information at their disposal Witness claims he cannot answer the question because the fed does not have estimates for that."

11635589072	100001	Yes, let me try to address that. You referenced the report that the State Department did. It was amazing work by some really talented State Department officers to go out and collect that data. I think the data speaks for itself in terms of the horrific nature of what took place there.    With respect to making this legal determination, I am not prepared to provide you an answer today. Know that we are still looking at it, frankly, that I am still looking at that more specifically. My objective here is to get a really good outcome, to change this behavior, then to hold those responsible accountable. I want to make sure that we do this in a thoughtful way. I get the messaging that takes place when a Secretary of State makes these designations. I value that and it is important. But I think we would all agree the most important thing we can do is get both accountability and behavioral change, and that is what the State Department is working to do. We are still actively considering how to approach those conclusions.	Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate that.    I would like to move on at this point to Burma. A year and a half ago, the Burmese military drove the Rohingya out of the Rakhine State through a campaign of killings and rapes and burning of villages, and some of the most horrific and unspeakable crimes that we had seen on this globe in a long, long time. We all appreciated when then-Secretary Tillerson, your predecessor, dubbed these atrocities as ethnic cleansing. Now, as you know, ethnic cleansing is a powerful message, but it does not have legal weight.    And since 2017, overwhelming evidence has come out that clearly shows that the Burmese military committed crimes against humanity. Even the Department's own investigation into these atrocities came to similar conclusions. Several entities, including the House, have concluded that these crimes constitute genocide. The State Department has not made any legal pronouncement at this point beyond ethnic cleansing.    Given all the evidence available to you, could you comment today if you are ready to conclude or where you are in determining whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military did constitute at least crimes against humanity?

It is a priority for the company. Having--	My time is almost up and I have one more question and I think it is important. You may not know this, Mr. Smith, but it is actually considered best practices in a company with lots of sensitive, personal information to have their chief information security officer have independent business lines that report directly to the CEO and to the board of directors.    But at Equifax, you were using an outdated corporate governance model and had your chief information security officer reporting to the general counsel, not directly to the CEO, and board.    So my question is, why was your chief information security officer not reporting directly to you and the board? And why were you using an old model?

We already took action by banning him from the platform, and we are going to be doing a full audit to make sure that he gets rid of all the data that he has as well.    To your point about Cambridge University, what we found now is that there was a whole program associated with Cambridge University where a number of researchers, not just Aleksandr Kogan--although to our current knowledge, he is the only one who sold the data to Cambridge Analytica.    There were a number of other researchers who were building similar apps. So we do need to understand whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

11422125006	1	I am not sure. I know that our team looked at it. I don't know whether they knew about it before then or not.	Paul Combetta with Platte River Networks posted to Reddit asking how to ``strip out a VIP's (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email.'' He went on, ``The issue is that these emails involve the private email address of someone you'd recognize, and we're trying to replace it with a placeholder address as to not expose it.''    This clearly demonstrates actions taken to destroy evidence by those operating Secretary Clinton's private server and by her staff. Certainly, Combetta did not take it upon himself to destroy evidence but had been instructed to do so by Secretary Clinton or her staff.

11531349132	101000	I would be glad to, sir. First of all, racial discrimination in mortgage lending, in any kind of lending, is completely unacceptable. Wherever we have authority we will use it to stop that from happening and punish it when it does happen.    We have some authority here. The CFPB has quite a lot of authority in this area as well, but where we have it for the banks that we supervise, we supervise carefully and aggressively to try to find these problems and address them.	Along those lines, I want to pick up where Mr. Meeks and Mr. Capuano questioned you. I have shared with your staff a recent article from my hometown newspaper about black home buyers continuing to be denied conventional mortgage loans at a much higher rate than whites, even when controlling for income, loan amount, and neighborhood.    In the St. Louis metropolitan area, African Americans who applied for conventional mortgages are two and a half times more likely to be denied than non-Hispanic whites. That is according to 2 years of recent HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) data.    Where there is loan activity houses have a chance to sell. Where houses sell, people move in. Where people move in, restaurants, community centers, and grocery stores are built. None or very little of that is happening in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods in St. Louis or elsewhere in this country.    My question is, what can the Federal Reserve do to ensure that applicants for home mortgages are treated equally and the bad actors who steer and redline communities of color are eliminated from this process or change their policies? Can you give me any direction in that area?	Can you give me any direction in that area?

11531349014	100100	Our current framework says that the committee would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation above or below 2 percent. We understand that inflation is going to be buffeted by various factors, and that it may not be exactly at 2 percent. It will be above; it will be below. We see it as a symmetric objective.    I would say that framework is working. The market understands it. We have been trying to get up to 2 percent. But generally speaking, inflation has been low and stable for 15 or 20 years now.	My time is starting to wind down. I would like to explore inflation targeting. In your testimony, it appears the Fed is keeping to their 2 percent inflation target. I am still trying to--I struggle with how this is commensurate with a statutory mandate for achieving price stability.    But I also saw from the FOMC minutes, the most recent minutes, that there was at least discussion about moving from the 2 percent target to a target range. At least 2 percent is a linear function. A range, obviously, is not.    I am really struggling with how is this commensurate with price stability? Some commentators are calling for a 3 percent, 4 percent target.    Two questions, number one, do we have an expectation the Fed will move from its 2 percent target?

Mr. Cohen answers the chairman in such a way that the chairman knows how to find the answers he seeks. The witness, I think, answers the question. He also adds information that is probably helpful to the senator.

11531349140	100000	Thank you, Mr. Lucas. What we are doing right now is we are taking a careful look at the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. I think our view is that the leverage ratio is a very important requirement for banks, but it should be a backstop. It should be a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital.    I think that the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio that we put into place in, I guess 2013 in that range, went a little too far. It unfortunately seems to be deterring some low-risk wholesale-type activities that we really want financial institutions to engage in. One of those is client clearing, and particularly not counting margin.    But I think our way of addressing that is going to be, I think, to lower the calibration of the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio. That does seem to get done what needs doing there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, I thank you for being here. Before I ask a general question and a broader question, I do note that I think you are my fourth Chairman to be able to visit within this environment since I have been a member of this committee.    I would like to discuss an issue with you today that you and I have already discussed. My good colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Luetkemeyer has a bill regarding, and that is the supplemental leverage ratio clearing margin.    I know that Blaine's bill has strong bipartisan support from members of this committee and the Ag Committee. In essence, it would offset those margin amounts for purposes of SLR because margin is inherently a risk management tool and legally must be kept separate from a bank's own funds.    The Fed can effect this change without legislation, however, and your predecessor showed a willingness to look at the issue.

11530956039	110000	Congressman, this is an important question because I think people often ask what the difference is between surveillance and what we do. And I think that the difference is extremely clear, which is that, on Facebook, you have control over your information. The content that you share, you put there. You can take it down at any time.    The information that we collect you can choose to have us not collect. You can delete any of it. And, of course, you can leave Facebook if you want. I know of no surveillance organization that gives people the option to delete the data that they have or even know what they are collecting.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Zuckerberg, welcome.    In the 1960s, our Government, acting through the FBI and local police, maliciously tricked individuals and organizations into participating in something called COINTELPRO, which was a counterintelligence program where they tracked and shared information about civil rights activists, their political, social, civic, even religious affiliations, and I personally was a victim of COINTELPRO.    Your organization, your methodology, in my opinion, is similar. You are truncating the basic rights of the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by the wholesale invasion and manipulation of their right to privacy.

11531349006	110000	No, sir. Our intention over the long term is that the balance sheet would be no larger than it needs to be to implement monetary policy, and that it would consist primarily of treasury securities.    We purchased the mortgage-backed securities in the aftermath of the crisis. That was an unusual practice, and it was something that we did in unusual circumstances. Those will run off over time, and I don't expect that we would use that tool again, other than in a very severe situation.	OK. As I understand it, though, I have not been able to see on the public record the expectation with respect to the composition of the balance sheet. I believe that currently you are carrying $2.4 trillion of treasuries, $1.8 trillion of mortgage-backed securities. Is our expectation--that is roughly back of the envelope, one-third, two-thirds ratio. Is it your intention to keep that same ratio of mortgage-backed securities?    Again, many of us are concerned about the possibility of the Fed involved in credit allocation decisions. Because right now, I don't really see a glide path to a treasuries-only balance sheet.

11636001109	100000	Congressman, I appreciate that question, and I know how Ohio has been dramatically affected by the opioid crisis. We have done a lot at the Department of Justice, and I would like to partner with this committee and I am sure General Barr would as well to combat and have additional tools to combat this opioid crisis. But some of the things that we have done is we set up in 2017 the Opioid Fraud and Detection Unit, which was a way that the Justice Department could utilize data to help combat the devastating opioid crisis. We did the largest healthcare fraud takedown in June of 2018. We set up the PIL Task Force, otherwise known as the Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force, in February of 2018. We set up a really innovative way called Operation SOS, which was Synthetic Opioid Surge. General Sessions and I went down to Tampa, Florida, where we saw Manatee County had taken an AUSA and embedded them once a week into the sheriff's office in order to take every fentanyl overdose case, and they dramatically reduced the number of overdose deaths in Manatee County. And we decided to take that model and apply it to the most affected States and districts that could really make a dramatic difference in saving lives.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Acting Attorney General, as you mentioned earlier, there are other important matters within the purview of the Justice Department and within the oversight responsibilities of this committee besides fishing expeditions, trying to get the goods on this President in an apparent effort to impeach him. For example, 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. I am old enough to remember back in the mid '80s when President Ronald Reagan and his wife felt so compelled to do something about the scourge of drugs in this country that the effort to just say no began and other efforts following that, and that was because back at that time, we had 10,000 deaths a year due to drug overdoses, and we now have over 70,000 deaths. So it is gotten, unfortunately, over time worse, not better. And most of the increase in deaths in 2017 were due to synthetic drugs, synthetic opioids specifically, like fentanyl, which accounted for a significant number of those deaths. This is clearly an epidemic which has been declared a state of emergency nationwide by the President and has deeply affected families in my home State of Ohio as well as families all across this Nation.    What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?

11497630018	100000	Mr. Chairman, the Department reviews facts and evidence submitted before it. We apply the law to those facts and evidence. We take all the appropriate steps in every matter that we review. And that is how we will essentially manage every matter under our purview, whether it relates to the IRS, to an e-mail matter, or every matter that comes before us.    And with respect to the President's comments, they have no influence or bearing on how the Department manages these matters. And I would have to refer you to him for a review of those.	I want to cover one more topic that concerns me greatly.    During the FBI's investigation of the IRS matter, the President stated on Super Bowl Sunday that there was not ``even a smidgeon of corruption at the IRS.'' At the end of that investigation, no charges were filed.    Two weeks ago, the President stated with respect to Secretary Clinton's e-mails, ``This is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.''    Should we expect that when the FBI finishes its investigation of this matter that no charges will be filed? Does the Department allow statements by the President to dictate its investigative practices?	Does the Department allow statements by the President to dictate its investigative practices?

And we have got a great ally in Colombia, and Colombia is doing the right thing by taking care of these folks who are in crises.    It just seems to me that it is in contrast to the position that we are taking on our southern border, because I do not hear any talks--I am now speaking to the members of the Colombian government--they are not saying they are being invaded. They have got millions of people crossing their border every day. They are not saying they are being invaded. There is no talk about building a wall. But, rather, they are calling for a coordination of humanitarian assistance and working within their group.    The fact of the matter is, in talking to some of the Colombian members of their government, I was talking to them not too long ago, yesterday to be a fact, they expect the possibility of a bigger crisis. They say 2-3 million people may be coming across. But they were going to try to make sure they take care of them, not prevent them from coming across.

11530242013	100000	So on the 8th of March we were notified, as you mentioned. On the 9th of March, following the standard protocol, the communication was disseminated to those who needed to know about the patch.    Two things happened, Mr. Chairman: One was a human error, an individual who was responsible for what we call the patching process did not ensure that there was communication and closed-loop communication to the person who needed to apply the patch. That was error number one.    Error number two was on the 15th of March, we used a technology called a scanning technology, which looks around the systems for vulnerabilities. That scanner, for some reason, did not detect the Apache vulnerability. So we had a human error, as I alluded to in my oral testimony, and a technological error, both resulting in the fact that it was not patched.	So what happened?	So what happened?

11530956113	110000	Congressman, yes. This is an extremely important area. After we were slow to identify the Russian information operations in 2016, this has become a top priority for our company to prevent that from ever happening again, especially this year in 2018, which is such an important election year with the U.S. midterms, but also major elections in India, Brazil, Mexico, Hungary, Pakistan, a number of other places.    So we are doing a number of things that I am happy to talk about or follow up with afterwards around deploying new AI tools that can proactively catch fake accounts that Russia or others might create to spread misinformation.    And one thing that I will end on here, just because I know we are running low on time, is, since the 2016 election, there have been a number of significant elections, including the French Presidential election, the German election, and last year the U.S. Senate Alabama special election.    And the AI tools that we deployed in those elections were able to proactively take down tens of thousands of fake accounts that may have been trying to do the activity that you are talking about. So our tools are getting better.    For as long as Russia has people who are employed who are trying to perpetrate this kind of interference, it will be hard for us to guarantee that we are going to fully stop everything. But it is an arms race, and I think that we are making ground and are doing better and better and are confident about how we are going to be able to do that.	OK. And, finally, let me say this: Many of us are very angry about Russian influence in the 2016 Presidential elections and Russian influence over our Presidential elections.

Specifically to your question, however, if a small businessman or woman was also the proprietor of that company, as an individual, they would be covered by what we are doing for them going forward, offering this free lock product for life. Number two, to clarify if I may, small businesses in America are very important customers of ours.	So, Mr. Smith, as Ranking Member of the House Small Business Committee, I am concerned about the impact this historic breach will have on our country's 29 million small businesses.

Last week, Senator Shaheen and I wrote a letter requesting information about Equifax efforts to help small business clients, but we haven't received any response.

11497630031	101000	Well, Mr. Congressman, I think there is a significant debate and discussion going on as to how to best save lives in that situation. And I think that all voices are necessary in that debate and discussion.    And, certainly, if Congress were to consider new laws, I'm sure this Committee would be deeply involved in discussions. And that is, of course, up to Congress as part of your purview, and the Department would be happy to work with you with regard to that.    I think that we also have to look at the root causes of the violence. As I indicated in a response to an earlier question, just last month I convened a summit on violence of several of the leaders of our major cities--police chiefs and mayors, as well as police executives. And what the Department is doing is looking for ways to identify the root causes of so much of the violence that we are seeing.    Even as violence is at historic lows nationwide, we still have some communities that struggle with this issue. In some instances, it is gun violence. In some instances, we see an increase in drug use--methamphetamines, heroin, opioids. And so we are trying to find our best ways to focus our resources there.    Just yesterday, I met with representatives from the National Conference of Mayors and had discussions on these very issues, about the differences that all communities present and the need to have a full and robust discussion about these issues.

But I will say, when people have asked--and I understand your question to be the meaning of ``gross negligence""--one always, as you know, refer to the statute itself, relevant cases, and then, of course, it is a very fact-specific inquiry.    And since to go further would go into the facts of this case, I'm not able to go further at this time."	Let me go back to what Mr. Sensenbrenner referred to. I think it's one of the great mysteries of this case, and that's why extreme carelessness--apparently not in his mind, and you accepted it, so I guess apparently not in your mind--did not constitute gross negligence.    Now, I'm an attorney. I practiced 16 years before coming here. And I've been on this Committee for 20 years now, so even though I'm not actually practicing law right now, I've been doing this type of thing for a long time.

Fairly typical in a complex, white-collar case, especially, as you try and work your way up toward your subject. So my overall reaction is this looks like ordinary investigative process to me.

11426003033	1000	Thank you, Congressman, for that question.    In our company, we have 14 outside directors. We have a lead director. All directors are New York Stock Exchange-independent, by their standards. I am not a member of any standing committee of that board. The independent directors and the lead director help set the agenda for the boards. They always have meetings that are in executive session without me.    And as you probably read about what happened this weekend--because we filed an 8-K yesterday about actions that they took as an independent board, and I was not part of that. So the board acts quite independently.

11532380114	1010	I would think that those matters are worthy of consideration. But as to the details of them and for me to express an ultimate comment today, I'm unable to so.	Great. Thank you very much.    I'm not and never was a prosecutor, but I did some criminal defense work back in the day when I practiced law for almost 20 years. It seems to me that a Presidential campaign using a law firm as a conduit to pay for activities with which the campaign itself doesn't want to be directly associated is more than just dirty politics; it's also, quite possibly, illegal. To me, it seems that this is at least a violation of campaign finance laws for failure to accurately disclose the actual recipients of campaign disbursements.    However, this type of arrangement is not illegal--if it's not illegal under current law, I fear that we're risking opening Pandora's box with all sorts of underhanded activities by campaigns being laundered through law firms and shielded under attorney-client privilege.    As the chief law enforcement official in this country, do you share similar concerns? And, in your opinion, is it legal under current law for a Presidential campaign to hide its funding of the compilation and dissemination of political dirt on its opponent by using a law firm to directly pay for the work?

11635589010	100000	So, I am of the nature that I try not to contemplate failure too often, but we have certainly considered what the risks are associated with the efforts that we have provided to date and the efforts. Frankly, you mentioned the Lima Group, all the countries in the region now, some 50-some that have recognized the proper leader, as designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.    Look, we have seen Russia continue trying to exert influence. We know that the Cubans are providing substantial support to the Maduro regime. Allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome continued destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. It will certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos, the economic, and refugees flowing from those regions, from Venezuela to the region as well. So, there is lots of downside if the Venezuelan people's objective is not achieved.    Second, the day and week after is going to be a long process. The Maduro regime's destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months. This is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that is going to cost, I have seen estimates between $6 and $12 billion, and years to repair. So, the day after means making sure the Cuban and Russian influence are out; Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy. And the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them through this transition period.    The United States will certainly be part of it, but I am confident we will find the coalition that we have built, some 50 countries strong, that our State Department has built, will be part of that as well.

Mr. Zuckerberg, you talked about how positive and optimistic you are, and I am--I guess, I am sorry, because I am not. I don't have much faith in corporate America, and I certainly don't have much faith in their GOP allies here in Congress.    I really look at everything that this committee does, or most of what this committee does, in terms of the right to know. In other words, I always fear that people, you know, that go onto Facebook, they don't necessarily know what is happening or what is going on with their data.    And so, to the extent that we could pass legislation--which I think we need, and you said that we probably should have some legislation--I want that legislation to give people the right to know, to empower them, to, you know, provide more transparency, I guess, is the best way to put it.

11531349029	100000	I do think this is a time when we need to be alert to buildup of either financial imbalances or to inflation building up. We don't really see those right now. I think I also said that in my 2015 speech.    But if you look at the financial stability situation broadly, we do see some high asset prices. What we don't see is the buildup of leverage among households. We see the banking system and the financial system generally as being very resilient. I think the financial stability picture shows at most modest risks.	Clearly the wave of bonuses and raises and the announcements certainly suggest that there is upward pressure on wages as a result of these tax cuts.

It has not been the practice of the committee to swear in witnesses, as you know. The witness has to sign before coming here that the testimony will be truthful. That should be sufficient.    The Chair yields himself 5 minutes for questions.    Mr. Smith, I know this is your fourth appearance before Congress, but I think you know it speaks to the gravity of the situation, the number of our constituents which are impacted and, frankly, the number of committee jurisdiction lines that this crosses.    Since you have testified three other times, I will attempt to plow a little new ground.

What do I say when, in fact, saying something that isn't true, handling classified information in an extremely careless way has no criminal ramifications? What do I say to them?

11531349109	101000	Let me say that the situation with LIBOR is such that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in London has said that they will no longer compel banks to submit their submissions to the LIBOR panel after the end of 4 years.    At that time, the FCA can no longer guarantee the continuation of LIBOR. Now if LIBOR were to stop being published then, there are $300 plus trillion worth of LIBOR-based contracts in the world. That has all the potential of being a pretty significant financial stability problem.    Solving it is very high priority for us and I think for financial regulators around the world. There will be costs to doing so, but they would be trivial in comparison to the failure to be ready for this change, should it be necessary.	Thank you Mr. Chairman.

Of course with treasuries, you know when they are going to mature and you can really see what that roll off is going to be. With mortgage-backed securities, roll off will depend on the level of interest rates and the level of people refinancing their mortgages.    As rates go up, refis will go down and you will see slower roll off--	The Monetary Policy Report that came out days ago shows the balance sheet roll off caps. What I am having a little trouble with is, as I look at the charts in the report, Mr. Chairman, you don't seem to have sufficient MBS (mortgage-backed security) redemptions that allow you to reach your $20 billion runoff pace.    As I read the charts, I think the expectation is by the end of the year, we are looking at a $50 billion balance sheet roll off.

11420722027	100100	Thank you, Congressman, for the opportunity to speak on these issues.    I believe that you have truly outlined the issue of the day facing our Nation. And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view.    I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement.    It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion.    I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities.    All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well. By recognizing our common humanity, our common loss, and our common goals, we can, in fact, work on this difficult problem.	Thank you.    Thank you for being here again, Attorney General, and thank you very much for your frank and candid discussion with us that is now taking place.    I'm looking for answers and views of some events that I'm going to string together and ask you to discuss as far as you can in an appropriate manner.    Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling. Video shows that he was shot while being pinned to the ground by two officers.    Outside of Minneapolis, police shot and killed Philando Castile at what should have been a routine traffic stop. He was armed, but reports suggest that he repeatedly told police that he had a valid permit for the weapon.    In Dallas, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded seven others in what appeared to be a well-planned attack--this terrible act in the middle of an otherwise peaceful protest in a city that has become a model for community-engaged policing.    And so I think you're qualified to advise us here, as both the chief law enforcement officer in the United States and the first African-American woman to hold that post.

And after several rounds of conversations with him about purchasing her life rights for $130,000, what I did, each and every time, is go straight into Mr. Trump's office and discuss the issue with him, when it was ultimately determined, and this was days before the election, that Mr. Trump was going to pay the $130,000, in the office with me was Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. He acknowledged to Allen that he was going to pay the 130,000, and that Allen and I should go back to his office and figure out how to do it.

11420722000	100000	Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.    As I've said on several occasions before, when the referral came into the Department of Justice, it was received and referred to experienced, dedicated career agents and prosecutors who handle matters of this type every day with independence, with efficiency, with thoroughness, and the matter was handled like any other matter.    It was reviewed through the chain by those independent career agents and prosecutors. And, in considering the matter, there was no connection, there was no need for recusal or an independent prosecutor.	Thank you, General Lynch.    We'll now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.

The existence of Secretary Clinton's private email server was first brought to light in March of last year, 1 month before your confirmation as Attorney General. A few months after your confirmation, the inspectors general of State and National Intelligence requested the Department of Justice investigate whether classified information was stored on her private email servers. The FBI then opened an investigation into the matter.    Given that she was a political appointee of your current boss and, more importantly, the wife of your previous boss, why did you not see fit to recuse yourself from the investigation?

Sessions it's explain that unauthorized disclosures is a complex process. That's why he is talking about various things and he is not trying to change the subject. Sessions agrees with the first question posed, that the release of names is a legal prohibition. He goes on to say that it is a 'grave offense' and goes against government policy. He also beings answering the second question posed. The witness avoided given a direct answer to the question by stating reasons why the names are been withheld

The President has also made numerous statements that turned out to be inaccurate. For example, he said he knew nothing about the hush money payments to Ms. Clifford.

Yet in your testimony, Mr. Cohen, you said that you met with the President in the Oval Office in February 2017 and discussed his plans to reimburse you for money you paid.

In other words, earlier the question was, would you trust Saudi Arabia with a bone saw; therefore, we cannot give them nuclear weapons or engage with them at all. I think an important point to note is I would not trust Iran with a bone saw. They have quite a few bodies, frankly, on their conscience from Syria, from a lot of places.    And so, I just want to commend you and the Administration for your decision to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. I think that was a smart move. I think it sent a very strong message that it is not just about the development of nuclear weapons over a period of 10 years; it is also about behavior in the region and development of ballistic missiles. So, I just want to commend you on that.    Closer to home--actually, I want to hit Yemen real quick. The very first thing this committee did--and I hate to obsess about it and channelize on it, but it has really stuck with me--the very first thing this committee did, Mr. Secretary, in the new Congress was, basically, to take away the authority of the Administration to be involved in any way with Yemen. And I think most of the members of this committee have never had a classified briefing on what is occurring in Yemen. They have never had a briefing on the SCIF. And I think there is a perception out there that it is the United States and Saudi Arabia that are creating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.    Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?

11531349088	100000	Yes, I will. We think we need the leverage ratio as a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital. We think that the current calibration of the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio is not appropriate. We are looking at a recalibration that would address that exact concern.	I want to move onto another topic, but continuing the discussion on the importance of getting our regulations right to benefit Main Street and rural America.    Minnesota's 6th Congressional District, which I represent, is home to some of the finest and most productive farmers and manufacturers in the world. Many of these same individuals and businesses, who are making such a positive economic impact on my district, are inadvertently harmed by the current formulation of the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) that fails to recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin.    This bank capital rule is increasing clearance costs for farmers and manufacturers, making it more expensive for them to use the cleared derivatives market.    I hope that as you and your colleagues at the Fed review the SLR that you come to the same conclusion that a coalition of Republican and Democrat members on this committee have, that we must recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin in a revised bank capital rule.

11635589012	100000	So, the first thing we did is we identified it, something previous Administrations were loath to do. I get it. We have important economic interests with China. Many American jobs depend on that. President Trump is doing his level best to set the trade relationship so that it is fair and reciprocal. So, I would describe that as the first thing the Administration did.    The second thing is we recognize this is a great power battle and we are engaged in it across the world. It is our support of ASEAN. It is identifying the threat from Chinese State-owned enterprise technology companies, sharing that with countries in the Middle East and in Europe, identifying these risks, so that Western democracies around the world will wake up to the risks and will push back.    And you mentioned One Belt One Road, in particular. We are doing our best to make sure that there are Western competitors every place there is a project that China is putting forth. We are happy to compete. If it is fair, transparent, open transaction, you know, the Chinese may win a few, but I am very confident that American businesses will do incredibly well there.    What we have seen is just the opposite. We have seen transactions that were not straight-up, that were not fair, that were designed with a national security interest, and not an economic interest for the people of their country. The State Department has shared with these countries and their people and their leadership the risks from entering into these. And frankly, I think countries throughout Asia/Southeast Asia are waking up to this concern as well.	And thank you. I think it is an historic opportunity for the region, the hemisphere. I think it will transform Venezuela, which is now a failed State. It was a prosperous nation. Now, 20 years later, it is in utter chaos. And I think it would also impact Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia. It could really transform the Western Hemisphere and be a major foreign policy victory.    On China, as I get my threat briefings, Islamist terror has always been the focus, but it seems to me that China now is becoming more the No. 1 threat in nation States. Can you tell me about the threat from China? In particular, what I am concerned about is the One Belt One Road Initiative. You know, their theft of intellectual property--they are in our medical institutions, our universities. But the One Belt One Road, they are literally overleveraging countries, and particularly in Africa, too, where they can take over these countries without a shot fired.

11531349123	101000	I think we are committed to being as transparent as we possibly can about monetary policy and about regulation. I think, if I remember what it was like back when I was an undersecretary of the Treasury in the 1990's, the Fed didn't even publish a post-meeting statement.    Now you look at the massive number of things we publish, we are much more transparent. I think we can continue on that path. We are never done with that.    In regulation, I think it is very important that we be transparent. In fact, we are working across a broad range of issues there, including, I would point out, stress testing.

11530956047	110100	Congressman, thank you. And let me say a couple of things on this. First, to your point about competition, the average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there is a lot of competition that we feel every day, and that is an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.    Second, on your point about regulation, the internet is growing in importance around the world in peoples' lives, and I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place for a lot of the reasons that you are saying.    I think a lot of times regulation, by definition, puts in place rules that a company that is larger, that has resources like ours, can easily comply with but that might be more difficult for a smaller startup to comply with.    So I think that these are all things that need to be thought through very carefully when thinking through what rules we want to put in place.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome to the committee.    A number of times in the last day or two you have indicated that, in fact, you are now open to some type of regulation. And we know, of course, that you are the dominant social media platform without any true competitor, in all frankness, and you have hundreds, if not thousands, of folks that are--would be required to help navigate any type of regulatory environment.    Some would argue that a more regulatory environment might ultimately stifle new platforms and innovators some might describe as desperately needed competition, i.e., regulatory complexity helps protect those folks like you. It could create a harmful barrier to entry for some startups, particularly ones that might want to compete with you.

11422125144	100	I can't at this point. What I can say in response to the first part of your question, any hacking is something we take very seriously. Any hacking in connection with this Nation's election system is something we take extraordinarily seriously, the whole of government. So it is something the FBI is spending a lot of time on right now to try and understand. So what are they up to and what does it involve and what is the scope of it to equip the President to decide upon the appropriate response. And so that is one of reasons I have to be very careful about what I say about it. That work is ongoing. I should make clear to folks when we talk about our election system, there has been a lot of press reporting about attempts to intrude into voter registration databases. Those are connected to the Internet. That is very different than the electoral mechanism in this country, which is not.	All right. I am hoping that we can get some insight in an appropriate classified setting on that.    Now, we have watched with some concern--and I know you are also concerned--about the Russian intrusion into our election system. It has been reported to us that the Russians hacked into the Democratic National Committee database. They also hacked into the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And it seems that they are making an effort to influence the outcome of this election. We have been warned that the information stolen might not just be released but also be altered and forged and then released, in an effort to impact the election here in the United States.    Yesterday, there were press reports--and I don't know if they are accurate, and I am interested if you are able to tell us--that the Russians have also hacked the telephones of Democratic staffers and that there was a request for Democratic staffers to bring their cell phones into the FBI to have them mirrored.

I want to follow up on what my friend from north Texas talked about on his cartoon. Next month, the general data protection regulation, the GDPR, goes into effect in the European Union.

11531349027	101000	Thank you, Chairman Barr. It is very hard to trace through the effects of a change in tax policy into things like wage growth in the economy. But let me try.    Lower corporate taxes should lead to higher investment. The effect is not easy to estimate but you would think and the studies find that it should lead to higher investment. Higher investment should lead to higher productivity over time, and higher productivity should lead to higher wages over time.    It is very hard to put your hands on exactly how much that would be, but higher productivity, of course, is very, very welcome, and will be driven by higher investment.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, congratulations again on your confirmation. I appreciate your commitment in our conversations to transparency and your demonstration of that commitment to date to clearly communicate the Fed's monetary policy trajectory.    You have noted on numerous occasions that the remaining slack that may exist in the labor market is at least in part attributable to stagnant wage growth. In your confirmation hearing, a Senator on the Banking Committee cited a 2016 Fed research paper concluding that corporate tax cuts do not translate into higher wages.    But we have seen a wave of corporate announcements of bonuses and raises since the tax cuts were enacted. Specifically over 4 million workers and counting have received over $3 billion in bonuses and raises during the last 8 weeks. The Labor Department recently announced the largest increase in wages since the end of the recession.    Based on these numbers, is the Senator in question, and are the Fed researchers that he cites, are they wrong and have tax cuts in fact helped increase wages as your testimony indicates that wages should be increasing at a faster pace as a result of a more stimulative fiscal policy?

The first, from July 24, 2017: ``So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General], looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?''    The second, from November the 3rd: ``Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and the FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.''    The third, also from November 3rd: ``Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI and Justice Dept.''    I believe he is referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren in that last one. When Richard Nixon spoke about us that way, at least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors.

11497630008	1000	Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.    With regard to the Department of Justice enforcement of the gun laws, we take those gun laws very seriously and are committed to using the full panoply of laws and regulations on the books.    We typically use those laws at the Federal level in conjunction with our many and numerous violent crime initiatives. For example, in my former position as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, many of our gang cases also carried with them firearms charges. They would not necessarily be the lead charge, they may not be reflected in the data that you have, but they certainly are an important tool in every prosecutor's arsenal in combating violent crime.    In the discussions----	Well, I think we'll be vulnerable, too, when it comes to people from Syria, when we can't get access to those databases because the country is in disarray, and we can't even gather information, fresh, new, because we can't access the people that we could talk to.    Let me move on to another topic. The latest available data from the Justice Department shows that, during fiscal year 2015, the government reported 6,002 new weapons convictions. This number is down 5.8 percent from the previous fiscal year, when the number of convictions totaled 6,373. Compared to 5 years ago, when there were 7,101 weapons convictions, the number for fiscal year 2015 is down 15.5 percent. Convictions over the past year are lower than they were 10 years ago. Overall, the data show that convictions of this type, weapons violations, are down 34.8 percent from the level of 9,206 reported in 2005.    The President has repeatedly called for new gun control laws, yet your department has seen weapons prosecutions and convictions fall to levels not seen in over a decade.    How do you explain such a precipitous drop in weapon prosecutions and convictions under this Administration? And why is such little emphasis placed on these types of prosecutions, when the President has called for yet more laws when the current laws are not being enforced?

Witness says he did not communicate the info to Mr. Flynn. witness answered the question well enough Attorney General Sessions gives further information about meetings and answers plainly about discussions with  Mr. Flynn. The witness answers the question. However, he adds information to sway opinion in his favor by stating he met with 25 ambassadors. He is suggesting that meeting with so many he would not remember what they discussed. I believe he is avoiding answering honestly. I think he knows exactly he spoke about with this particular individual. Questioner repeats a reasonable yes/no question. Witness answers by saying no, but adds information about the number of meetings he has and that he does not recall talking with Mr. Flynn about the subject. The implication is that because the witness has so many meetings, it would be understandable if he didn't remember if he did or did not talk to Mr. Flynn about any given subject.

11531504117	101000	Congress has been very helpful in providing a small refinery exemption under the statute. It is objectively determined. It is 75,000 barrels, as you indicated, production and we have received I think 24 applications in 2017, a little bit over 30 in 2018. And I would say to you that the volatility of the RIN trading platform is creating instability across the entire RFS discussion.    So it is really in everyone's best interest to get more clarity and confidence in how this RIN trading platform and relief needs to occur. It is going to benefit the ethanol industry, benefit the ag sector, and I think benefit those that are suffering with the RIN obligations. And so it is our hope that we can chart a path forward with Congress to achieve those kinds of outcomes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Administrator, for coming before us. I think that was the first policy question you got from the other side of the aisle. Observation.    And to the public, I think this has been a lot of a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that we are seeing too often here in Washington that, unfortunately, I think works against civility and respect for people in public office. I am hoping we would be able to stay on policy today as much as we could, but I can see some just can't resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand.    So, having said all that, I thank you for what you have done. You have been able to stay disciplined on these policies. I know in West Virginia the impact that it has had on Brownfields Legislation of what you are doing on that I see the rollback of some of the regulatory reform that there is hope now. A lot of the people in the fossil fuel industry that they could see that deterioration in the past 8 years prior to that. There is some hope. We are seeing the economy start to rebound thanks to you and the administration of taking this fight on.    So I know that if I could, I know just as an example, here was an example that despite what has been said to the achievements that you have made that the EPA just awarded $1.9 million to research in drinking water having to do with Flint, that research in Flint. People are ignoring the progress that we are making and they are trying to make this another attack on President Trump, and unfortunately there are a lot of people that are going to go along with that.    So if we could, if I could get back to one of the things that has disturbed me some with some of the events over the last numbers of years was we had a good friend in Leslie Lampton who passed away last week. Lampton has Ergon Refinery located in Mississippi but they have the only refinery in West Virginia. It is a small, kind of a boutique operation at 23,000 barrels. I know the definition of a small refinery is 75,000 barrels, so they are a third of the size. But yet, so they are struggling meeting all of the qualifications, all the requirements of a major refinery.    Is there something that we could work together or something to help out these small refineries so that they can compete? Because they can't handle the RINs, they don't have a market for that with them. So is there something that we could be doing to help out these boutique refineries?

His offering of their effectiveness is irrelevant. Framing of questioner's inquiry indicates incredulity -- ""you were X, but you didn't do Y?"" Implication is that Y is necessarily a part of being X. Witness reframes the question and does not give a yes or no answer about whether he recalls discussing the topic -- instead, he talks about his own position within the campaign. Likely evading because the answer is unfavorable."
11635589079	100000	So, you asked three questions there, I believe. The first one was what was my knowledge base. I think at that time I knew most of what had taken place, although I do not recall the exact sequence. I certainly have learned more about that since then. I have learned additional facts since that moment in time.    The second question was did I discuss the murder. The answer is yes. I think I said it that day, that I had discussed the murder with him.    And then, the third question is how will we hold them accountable. You have seen the Trump Administration do just that with respect to 17 individuals. We are continuing all across the government, certainly with overt means and all the tools that we have in our capacity, to learn more facts about this. President Trump has made very clear that we will continue to work to identify those who are responsible for Jamal Khashoggi's murder and hold them accountable. We will. I stand by that today. I am sure President Trump will as well.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome back, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for being here.    Mr. Secretary, I do not want to talk at a political level today with you. I want to talk from the heart. And I want to talk about a matter of justice on behalf of one of my constituents well known to you. I want to show you a picture.    This picture took place on November 19th, 2017 in my district. I am holding a cane because I had had a bad accident at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, a few months before and I still needed a cane to hobble around, not the most flattering picture of me.    Next to me is a man named Jamal Khashoggi. He is a mild-mannered man. He and I are discussing Middle East issues. He was a Saudi citizen, family, children, had on occasion worked for the Saudi government or for members of the royal family. He was mild-mannered, soft-spoken, and a moderate critic of the Kingdom. He wanted to see modernization. He wanted to see reforms. He was a columnist sometimes for The Washington Post, our local newspaper here in Washington.    On October 2d, 2018, 11 months later, my constituent, a legal resident of the United States who lived in Tysons Corner in Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia, was lured into the sovereign territory, the consulate of the Saudi government in Istanbul because he was seeking papers to get remarried. He had his fiancee outside waiting for him. He had been to the consulate before, and they had lulled him into believing he would be safe. But, of course, he was not.    What we know was that, on that day, two planes under the control of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia flew in with two teams whose objective was to either kidnap or kill Mr. Khashoggi. One presumes the objective involved killing because, not a diplomatic tool normally, they brought with them a bone saw. We know all of that because of revelations from Turkey. But those revelations, as I understand it, have been confirmed by our intelligence community; you would know better than I.    Nonetheless, what we do know is the Saudi government lied consistently. They lied about whether he safely left the consulate that day, knowing full well he did not. They lied about his murder. They lied about the conspiracy to murder him. They lied about who did it and how it was done.    And I guess I want to show you another picture, Mr. Secretary. This is a picture that took place 14 days after the murder. And that shows you and the Crown Prince, who many believe orchestrated and ordered the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, my constituent. And I guess what this picture raises is a question. At what point, as Americans, do we insist that the inalienable rights enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, all three of which were denied my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi, when do they trump diplomatic nicety? Is there ever a time when we are going to, as a country, insist, you know what, we are not going to do business as normal and we are going to hold you to account?    Now, at that meeting, you said, I believe, that they would be held to account, but you were meeting with a man who was assuring you they would be held to account, when he is himself suspected strongly of having orchestrated the murder. And so, I guess I want to ask you, Mr. Secretary, were you aware of the fact at that point of the gruesome details of the murder of my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi? Did you discuss that murder with the Crown Prince? And how are we going, moving forward, to hold the Crown Prince and the Saudi government responsible for one of the most grisly episodes ever to occur in a consulate or an embassy in our diplomatic experience?

11530956005	1000	Mr. Chairman, you are right that we don't sell any data, and I would say that we do try to explain what we do as time goes on. It is a broad system. You know, every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our products, whether it is Facebook or Messenger or Instagram or WhatsApp, to put in a piece of content, whether it is a photo that they want to share or a message they want to send someone, and every time there is a control right there about who you want to share it with.    Do you want to share it publicly to broadcast it out to everyone? Do you want to share it with your friends, a specific group of people? Do you want to message it to just one person or a couple of people? That is the most important thing that we do, and I think that in the product that is quite clear.    I do think that we can do a better job of explaining how advertising works. There is a common misperception, as you say, that is just reported--often keeps on being reported--that for some reason we sell data.    I can't be clearer on this topic: We don't sell data. That is now how advertising works. And I do think we could probably be doing a clearer job explaining that, given the misperceptions that are out there.	And you have recently said that you and Facebook have not done a good job of explaining what Facebook does. And so, back in 2012 and 2013, when a lot of this scraping of user and friend data was happening, did it ever cross your mind that you should be communicating more clearly with users about how Facebook is monetizing their data?    I understand that Facebook does not sell user data, per se, in the traditional sense. But it is also just as true that Facebook's user data is probably the most valuable thing about Facebook.

11635589143	111000	Yes, look, the good news is I am hopeful that Martin Griffiths, the U.N. Special Envoy in Yemen, in the next handful of days will make progress. He may not. We have a great agreement in Stockholm. We have not been able to enforce it. The Houthis have refused to withdraw from the Port of Hodeidah. I hope that they will in the coming days. Frankly, if I were betting, I would probably bet against, but one lives in hope.    Congress obviously has its own independent right to act as it so chooses. It has its constitutional authorities. I can say this: I hope everyone who cares about the people of Yemen understand that the legislation that passed did not remotely benefit them. Indeed, it will work to their detriment.

11426003062	101000	Thank you for that question.    We have agreed with our regulators to go back to 2011. We voluntarily said last week that we will go back to 2010 and 2009. I've told our team to leave no stone unturned. And if we find a situation where a customer is harmed that goes back prior to that, we will make it right for that customer.	Well, it seems very, very suspicious that your largest sale was right after your $1.8 trillion bank was turned into a school for scoundrels.    You acknowledge that your bank fired over 5,300 people who got caught willfully defrauding your customers. And a recent lawsuit alleges that you fired even more people because they refused to willfully defraud customers. And then you blame the low-level people, you fire them. You make profits, then you dump the stock.    So I just have to say that it seems that when you found out about the fake accounts, instead of helping your customers, you first helped yourself.    So, moving right along to the next question, Mr. Stumpf, you've said that Wells Fargo is conducting a review of all accounts going back to 2009 in order to identify any scam accounts. But last week, in the Senate hearings, you were asked if you would extend the review period to before 2009, and you refused to commit to extending the review period back to even earlier.    So if you were presented with hardcore evidence that Wells was engaged in some of these practices, these illegal scams prior to 2009, would you change your mind about extending the review?

11420722033	101000	Thank you, Congressman, for the question.    Let me be clear that my decision was to accept the recommendation of the team of agents and investigators who worked on this. And these are the career attorneys as well as the dedicated investigators, including the FBI Director, who worked on this matter for over a year.    They've reviewed the facts. They followed the facts. They looked at the law. They've applied the facts to that law and came up with a unanimous recommendation----	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being with us today.    You are in charge of the Department of Justice. The buck stops with you. And I'm concerned that you keep on saying that you have deferred the authority that by law is yours to Director Comey.    Let me give an example. Mr. Comey has said that Secretary Clinton was extremely careless in her handling of highly classified, very sensitive information. Now, the criminal statute uses the word ``gross negligence.'' And I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference between ``gross negligence'' and ``extremely careless'' is unless one really wants to parse some words.    Now, secondly, the misdemeanor statute does not require intent. It's a strict liability statute, and it relates to the removal and retention of classified information. So it doesn't matter whether Secretary Clinton had the intent to do that or not; the fact is that the FBI said that she did it.    Now, I think that what Director Comey has said is that Secretary Clinton's actions essentially meet the definition for prosecution under the statute.

But I believe this was to sway in their favor because as attorney general I can't imagine they did not know. Questioner does not allow witness response and tries to go on to another allegation while pretending he has extracted information from the witness. The witness tries to get the truth out and correct the misinformation from the questioner. again, witness failed to answer the question Sessions reports that he does not have knowledge of further contact with Russia. He does not fully address the topic of preventing the campaign from correspondence. It appears he is interrupted. The witness did not answer the question. I do not think the senator was saying there was ""definitely"" further contact. He is asking if the witness did anything to ensure there was no further contact. The witness, again, is eluding the question. It sounds like he is avoiding the question because he actually did nothing. He did not take any steps to ensure no further contact between Russia and the Trump campaign officials. Saying ""I don't believe"" , to me, is translated (like I don't recall) into ""I do not want to tell you."" Therefore, I would say this witness is lying and completely avoiding this line of questioning.

11531504023	1100	This effort----	Well, then, I am concerned that you have no idea of what is going on in your name at your Agency, especially on an issue already under IG investigation. You have spent this week claiming to champion transparency, but on Tuesday you blocked the press from attending an event where you announced a new proposal that will severely limit the Agency's use of public health studies in policymaking.    When internal emails came out about this new policy last week, they revealed that it had been developed entirely by political staff, seemingly without a robust outside stakeholder process, and once the press started covering those emails they were removed from the Agency's public FOIA portal. I do not know if you were personally involved in the decision to remove those emails, but it certainly was not transparent.    Mr. Administrator, you like to claim that you support the rule of law and acknowledge the limits of EPA's authority. Many of our environmental statutes are clear.

11497630094	101000	And, again, thank you for that issue, because it is an important one. And as you noted, certainly it's the Department's position that as a general matter all who appear before tribunals, whether they be courts, administrative bodies, tend to have a more efficient process and a fairer process if they are represented by counsel. Certainly we have statutes and laws to that effect with regard to adults, criminal matters, and the like.    For those children, also it certainly would seem to increase efficiency of the entire process to have counsel. And as you've noted, I believe through our grant process we have supported nonprofit or NGO organizations that have provided counsel there for those children.	Fair enough.

11531349059	1100	Thank you. Of course when we are setting monetary policy we are focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment. In doing that, we consider many, many factors all around, the global economy, et cetera.    Fiscal policy changes can have an effect, and changes of this size can have an effect. That can be seen, of course, in the path to policy. It is very hard to say in advance what that would be, but the answer to your question is generally we take all those things into account.	Chairman Powell, welcome. As the Chair of our committee points out, you are required to be independent and accountable. You are also required to be tall and short.    Your opening statement mentions great exports. But you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by $60 billion in the last year. I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit. That is why the country elected Donald Trump President.    Now, the Chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017. He is right. We had Obama's fiscal policies, Obama's tax policies, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, Janet Yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet, and we had a great year.    As a matter of fact, we have been on a roll since 2011. We were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we would have a labor shortage and higher wages. We were going well, and so instead of continuing to be on a roll, we have abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy, throwing away the budget caps, $1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill.    But I think that we will still do well because our scientists, our entrepreneurs, and our workers are the best in the world, and they will make up for all the mistakes we are making here in Washington.    I see behind you, sir, the green shirts that call for full employment. It is not enough to go with the economists' definition of full employment, say 4 percent. We need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor.    That is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for 2 percent, but 2-1/2 percent inflation. That is the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now.    Now, when we talk about some workers getting a $1,000 bonus, yes, a few have, but a family of five's share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000. What greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country than that some charlatan can say, ``Here is the deal. I will give you $1,000. It is money in your pocket, and we will just slap a $26,000 mortgage on your future.''    Now, Chairman Powell, in your confirmation hearings, you said that, I believe, that no bank is any longer too big to fail. I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail; they would pull the entire economy down. We had to bail them out with $700 billion.    I would point out that the Wall Street prices into the value of the banks' stock, but more importantly, to the value of their unsecured debt, an implicit Federal guarantee, an assumption that they will be bailed out.    I have a number of questions for the record, but I will actually ask one for you to respond to. We have adopted these profligate fiscal policies. Huge tax cuts leading to a massive increase in the deficit number that is right behind you, then we busted the budget caps.

11635589016	100000	Yes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary of State, thank you and welcome.    I want to talk a little bit about the Western Hemisphere and what is going on. I see a bigger plan in what is going on in Venezuela I think than most people. I see a lot of similarities of what happened with Cuba and what is happening in Venezuela. In Cuba, they allowed the people to leave that were disenchanted with the government. In Venezuela, there are 5,000 people leaving every day. They expect, by the end of this year, to be about 5 million people that have left Venezuela, those who are disenchanted with this government.    I really believe that there is a bigger plan here to destabilize the Western Hemisphere with what is going on in Venezuela. You have a million people putting a great deal of pressure on Colombia, and they have opened their doors and they have done a great job in helping these people. You have 700,000 people going into Peru. You have people all the way down to Argentina. Some of these countries cannot absorb the quantity of people that are leaving Venezuela daily. So, to me, I think this is part of a bigger plan to destabilize this whole region.    It continues to keep us busy. It continues to make America the bad apple in all this. And I would hope that we will continue to put pressure on Maduro. I do not believe in military action, but I do believe that sanctions will be effective and working with the Lima Group will be very effective.

11530242059	110000	Congresswoman, I understand your point, and it is my understanding we were in compliance with the safeguards rule and that the safeguards rule does not prevent 100 percent against data breaches.	Thank you.    Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.    So in my mind, this is the most open and shut violation of the safeguards rule that I have ever seen in the history of this country.

11530956129	11000	Congressman, I think you are raising an important point, which is that I think if someone wanted to know, they could. But I think that a lot of people probably just accept terms of service without taking the time to read through it.    I view our responsibility not as just legally complying with laying it out and getting that consent but actually trying to make sure that people understand what is happening throughout the product.    That is why every single time that you share something on Facebook or one of our services, right there is a control in line where you control who you want to share with. Because I don't just think that this is about a terms of service. It is contextual. You want to present people with the information about what they might be doing and give them the relevant controls in line at the time that they are making those decisions, not just have it be in the background sometime or upfront make a one-time decision.

11637282031	1001	I'm not in a position to judge a statement like that. The way OSC works is we get complaints about statements. There is an investigation opened and started, and we don't just give----	Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note at the outset that, while the Hatch Act does not apply to--it does not Members of Congress. And it is always interesting to hear from my friends on the other side about the blending of political and official when every day we see examples of elected officials using their current positions to propel their Presidential campaign messages.    Having looked through the materials in preparation for this hearing, I can't help but feel that the Office of Special Counsel's interpretation of the Hatch Act means that President Trump's top advisers must subscribe to the legal and political fiction that you can decouple an opponent's Presidential campaign from their current elected position.    And my concern with the OSC's interpretation of the Hatch Act at least appears to be bipartisan. Chairman Cummings even sent a letter to OSC on December 7 of last year, and here's a direct statement: OSC's guidance is wrong. There is no limit that criticizing a policy of a sitting President or any other politician is a violation of the Hatch Act.    Apparently that applies unless you're an adviser to this President.    But all that aside, President Trump's advisers are going to continue to act as his surrogates. So going forward, maybe we can help--maybe this hearing can help us understand what a senior counselor to the President is allowed to say on TV or social media without personally offending Mr. Kerner or anybody else in the OSC's office.

The question itself seems very simple to me, so it is my feeling that it is likely the witness would prefer to avoid giving a straight answer. While he is obviously not outright lying by asking for clarification, I do not believe he is sincere. Asks for clarification on exactly what they are being asked. Chairman wants to pin the witness down on a specific question, but the Witness asks clarifying question of the Chairman rather than answering.

11530956094	100100	Congressman, this is an important question to clarify. So, in 2007, we launched the platform in order to make it so that people could sign into other apps, bring some of their information and some of their friends' information to have social experiences.    This created a lot of innovative experiences, new games, companies like Zynga. There were companies that you are familiar with like Netflix and Spotify had integrations with this that allowed social experiences in their apps. But, unfortunately, there were also a number of apps that used this for abuse, to collect people's data.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here, Mr. Zuckerberg.    Two things: First of all, I want to thank Facebook. You streamlined our congressional baseball game last year. We have got the managers here.

I don't want to do it very much because it is my dad, and he would be mad if he went international like you are. And he has been on Facebook for a long time. He is 88. It has been good for connecting with kids and grandkids.    I just got my mother involved on an iPad and--because she can't handle a keyboard. And so--and I did this last week.

11530956018	1100	Congressman, what we allow with our developer platform is for people to choose to sign into other apps and bring their data with them. That is something that a lot of people want to be able to do.    The reason why we built the developer platform in the first place was because we thought it would be great if more experiences that people had could be more social. So, if you could have a calendar that showed your friends' birthdays, if you could have an address book that had pictures of your friends in it, if you could have a map that showed your friends' addresses on it.    In order to do that, you need to be able to sign into an app, bring some of your data and some of your friends' data, and that is what we built. Now, since then, we have recognized that that can be used for abuse too, so we have limited it so now people can only bring their data when they go to an app.    But that is something that a lot of people do on a day-to-day basis is sign into apps and websites with Facebook, and that is something that we are going----	All right. Now, you said yesterday that each of us owns the content that we put on Facebook and that Facebook gives some control to consumers over their content, but we know about the problems with Cambridge Analytica.    I know you changed your rules in 2014 and again this week, but you still allow third parties to have access to personal data.

11420722064	100000	Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.    And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?

Certainly, with respect to the existing state of the law, the Department of Justice is committed to fully following that.

11532380118	110000	Well, many States have capital punishment. The Federal Government has capital punishment for a number of offenses, and it is specifically controlled. We have within the Department a recommendation process through our appointed committee to seek or not seek a death penalty when a case is charged. Sometimes it's a complex thing.    But I believe the death penalty, the Federal death penalty, is a part of our law. I think it's a legitimate penalty. It's constitutional. And we will do our duty, even in those circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty.	Okay. It seems to me that there's always been a tremendous amount of gray area in that whole field, which I think, as a Nation, you know, we need to look much more closely at, both from the State's point of view and the Federal Government point of view. But that's just my feeling on that.    I'm running out of time. I had about four other things, but let me just go to one final thing here.    I've been very involved in the area of victims' rights. I was the--following Henry Hyde's leadership on this, introduced a victims' rights constitutional amendment years back, various pieces of legislation on victims' rights. And I've also worked closely with the parents of murdered children. And when you talk about something that affects one's family, there's nothing that affects a family more adversely than something like that happening.    And we still have capital punishment on the books, both at the Federal level and many of our States. Yet these families are dragged left and right, up and down, back and forth, into hearing after hearing.

11637282024	101100	Well, Mr. Chairman, I think from OSC's perspective, we try to apply the law as fairly as we can. To emphasize what I said in my opener, we're going to treat the well-connected the same as the little guy we are going to have one standard. We're not going to have a two-tier Hatch Act enforcement system. Obviously, cases with ordinary Federal workers go to the board, the board sometimes also imposes punishment that may differ from what we recommend.    So sometimes that's simply--imposing discipline is not something OSC does, but we are going to bring cases fairly and equally, and that's what we've done here.	I wonder if you've got, again, these 2 million Federal employees, and I'm sure these cases do come up, and where they may have one violation.

11393834114	100000	This is still an ongoing investigation, that is correct.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe that in his testimony he actually--the response to why there was a 2-month wait was that he was informed, and then for the next 2 months they were attempting to recover the lost emails from other host computers where those emails were located. So that just because you lose the emails from Ms. Lerner's hard drive, where she was the ``from'' sender, that they would exist in the ``to'' recipients. Computers never--I believe over 80 other host computers where they were looking. So that is part of the delay.    But I would like to know, also, the full extent of what was going on, as well.    Deputy General Cole, as I am sure you are aware the nature of the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS practices regarding the tax-exempt applications has been such a lengthy, lengthy discussion before various congressional committees. Despite unsubstantiated allegations that the Justice Department has prematurely closed its investigation for political reasons, Attorney General Holder has repeatedly confirmed before both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees that the Justice Department and FBI are still actively investigating this matter.    On January 29, 2014, the attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the matter, and I quote: ``is presently being investigated. Into the use of being done, an analysis is being conducted.''    Several months later, in April--on April 8 of 2014--the Attorney General further testified before the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed that the department's investigation was still an ongoing matter that the Justice Department is actively pursuing.

Witness directly answers yes and provides details. The witness does answer the question and adds very helpful information. I believe the witness could not have answered the question in any other way. Mr. Kerner provides details about why he and the Board made their decision to fire Ms. Conway. Mr. Kerner very adequately answers and affirms the decision, giving an adequate description of the factors that influenced his decision."

11531504126	101000	I think Mr. Kelly, if he is willing to share that with you, he should do that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do want to ask a couple questions about the Superfund program, particularly about your friend Mr. Albert Kelly, who you put in charge of the program despite his past. He was scheduled to appear before the committee in January, but he backed out at the last minute, citing travel obligations. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were disappointed in that, but Mr. Kelly sent a letter for the record that he would be willing to answer any and all of our questions regarding his lifetime ban from the banking industry and the illegal activities that led up to that.    It is now more than 3 months later, we have gotten no information from Mr. Kelly. We are told that political leadership has been preventing him from speaking with us, and if that is true, that is certainly disappointing. Two weeks ago, you were interviewed on Fox News by Ed Henry, and he asked you several questions about Mr. Kelly. In the interview, you said that the details of the settlement with the FDIC were private, and that none of us really know what happened.    So my question is, if Mr. Kelly is happy to share the details of his lifetime banking ban as a matter of transparency, is he not telling us the truth, or are you stopping him from doing that?

11532380000	110100	Mr. Chairman, as a former Federal prosecutor who emphasized gun prosecutions, I've long believed that they have a significant impact in reducing violent crime. Professors, earlier this year, have explained that they share that view based on scientific analysis. It will be a high priority of ours. You are correct that prosecutions fell.    One instance that was raised during the Texas--terrific, horrible shooting at the church there in Sutherland, Texas, was the ability of an individual to get a firearm and whether or not they filed correctly their form before you get one that--it requires questions about criminal convictions and court marshals.    Those prosecutions, I've noticed, have dropped by over 50 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. I think those are worthy prosecutions. And when a criminal is carrying a gun during a criminal act of some other kind, that is a clear and present danger to the public. And those cases are important, and the impact: reduction of crime.	Well, thank you, General Sessions.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions, and I will begin by recognizing myself.    Under your leadership, the prosecution of firearms offenses have increased 23 percent over the same period of the previous year. Furthermore, the number of defendants charged with using a firearm in violent crimes of drug trafficking rose 10 percent over the previous year.    We have a slide which shows the increase as compared to the Obama-era numbers.

You know, I listened, Mr. Administrator, to your reasons why you haven't resigned and basically you said that you are staying because only you can carry out the President's mission. And I strongly disagree with that. I think your actions are an embarrassment to President Trump and distract from the EPA's ability to effectively carry out the President's mission and if I were the President I wouldn't want your help, I would just get rid of you. But I am not the President so let me move on.    It has been reported that you have even gone so far as to retaliate against EPA's employees, punishing those who questioned your spending and management, and sidelining those who attempted to advance important public health protections. So I wanted to ask again, yes or no, because we don't have a lot of time, it has been reported that at least five EPA employees were recently reassigned, demoted, or otherwise retaliated against after they raised concerns about your spending.

11531504000	111000	Well, Mr. Chairman, I think both are important, and I do think there are some regulatory options that we can pursue. Many have talked about transparency as an example with respect to the trading platform and the RFS trading platform, how long you can hold a RIN as an example, who can buy, who can sell RINs. There are those kinds of, I think, evaluations that we can engage from a regulatory perspective. And, as you know, there is also consideration about the RVP waiver and the E15 being allowed year-round.    I think that is something, it is a legal determination. It is not a policy determination. And we have been earnest the last several months evaluating that in hopes that we can get to a conclusion on our ability to take those kinds of actions. But I really believe that Congress' role in this is terribly important because as you look at the issues that we are facing with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard and the viability of the RINs platform we need both Congress and our regulatory responses to be working together.	The gentleman yields back his time. The Chair thanks the Administrator. I will start the series of questioning, and I will recognize myself for 5 minutes for the first round.    We have obviously a lot of media presence here. I have been asked the last couple days what am I going to do, what am I going to say, and I said, ``Well, I am going to talk policy and stewardship.'' So half my 5 minutes is going to be on a policy issue, and hopefully that will save some time for us to talk about some stewardship issues.    Since you last testified before the subcommittee, the White House has hosted a number of meetings, some of which have included you and other Cabinet officials, senators, and various stakeholders, to discuss changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard.

11636001038	1010	Mr. Chairman, I see that your 5 minutes is up, and so--I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to a 5-minutes round, and----	I don't think you did, but let me just say this: Your iteration of the Department's longstanding policy appears designed to delay answering these questions as long as possible. I find that unacceptable. I understand the role of executive privilege and respect its value in our system of governance. However, Congress is a coequal branch of government. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight. This is a responsibility we take very seriously.    I have repeatedly tried to work with your office first in delaying the hearing until February and then in providing you our questions in advance. I did this because the executive branch's own rules governing assertion of privilege, which were issued by President Reagan and have been followed ever since, say that ultimately it is up to the President to decide whether or not he wants to assert executive privilege. You cannot repeat forever that the President might want to assert privilege.    I have given you a fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing and to speak with the White House in advance so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that. The Department's failure to do its due diligence here to me is deeply troubling. I do not believe that issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem, but I am going to give you the opportunity to rectify the situation.    After today's hearing, we will attempt to reach an accommodation with the Department to obtain answers to these questions. As part of that process, I ask for your commitment to return for a deposition before this committee in the coming weeks under oath with an understanding that the transcript will be released to the public as soon as practicable thereafter.    Any questions that are unanswered today or require consultation with the White House will be asked again at that proceeding, and I expect either a clean answer or a proper assertion of privilege claimed by the President. I would ask members on both sides of the aisle to make those questions clear for the record so we know what must be addressed at the future proceeding.    Now, in your capacity as Acting Attorney General, have you ever been asked to approve any requests or action to be taken by the special counsel?

11531349031	100100	Flattening of yield curves in the past has been a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold inflation down.    That is not the situation we have now. It is very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up, as the economy strengthens. I don't see a particularly large--there is always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.	If I could point out a possible risk that is out there and have you react to it that was created by the unconventional monetary policy. Some have blamed the Fed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by producing an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates exceeded long-term rates.    At the beginning of 2011, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was almost 3 percent. But as of February of this year, that same spread has been whittled down to a mere 0.5 percent, and this is a 450 percent drop. Given a flattening yield curve, and economic conditions that you can see, call for raising the Fed funds rate, how will the Fed avoid another inverted yield curve?    Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer-term assets more quickly to counteract that flattening yield curve?

11532380042	101000	Well, we can. And the constitutional rights of Americans should be protected. And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.    I know the committee has decided to put some additional restrictions on the way the act is conducted. We did not think that was lawfully required. Congress can make its own decisions, and we will continue to be able to share our thoughts about how the legislation should be crafted.	Thank you very much.    Welcome, Mr. Attorney General.    We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise? Can't we allow the intelligence community to stop terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans?

11497630029	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    With respect to the Department's enforcement of our various civil rights statutes, it is certainly robust and will continue to be so. While we no longer have the advantage of the preclearance provisions that were in the Voting Rights Act, we still have significant provisions of the Voting Rights Act that allow us to review actions and decisions taken, albeit after the fact, to determine whether there has been either a discriminatory intent or, as is very often the case, a discriminatory result.    We can engage in negotiation and conversations. Many times, we do that before we even move to litigation in an attempt to reason with or have a discussion with entities that are making significant changes. And often those discussions are very productive. I was pleased to see that, after discussions with Members of Congress, the State of Alabama may be making some modifications to those changes. And, certainly, those types of discussions are an efficient way to bring about change and raise these important issues.    But I will reiterate, Congressman, that the Department of Justice is committed to enforcing the civil rights laws that we do have on the books. And we are committed to a vigorous review of matters that are brought to our attention and will ensure full and fair and efficient review of those matters and take the action that is appropriate.	Thank you.    The State of Alabama's plan to close 31 driver's license offices demonstrates how one policy decision can have wide-ranging discriminatory effects. The media's picked up on this. And this will make it harder for citizens of these rural counties to vote.    And I'm just as concerned about the discriminatory economic effects of this decision, which will fall hardest on rural, poor, and African-American communities. I imagine a Black farmer driving hundreds of miles across rural Alabama to renew an expired driver's license. And, on this Committee, we know what might happen to such a young man.

I would suggest to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, he must not be saying when he's saying that he's seeking one honest that everyone on this side of the aisle is somehow dishonest. I know that can't be the case, particularly when some of us have broken ranks, for example, offering and asking for a subpoena with respect to child separation policies.    But to suggest that we're somehow dishonest by saying you're seeking to find one honest man because we believe that this is a charade and a waste of the time of the American people, I think that that is a questionable direction to go.

11531349067	1001	I think I will follow the path of my predecessors and not become a regular commentator on fiscal issues, but rather limit myself to a couple of overarching points.	I appreciate your articulating that. You have also said that raising the ceiling is only the first step. The job that must be attacked is deficit reduction and addressing the cost associated with mandatory spending.    We heard a similar thing from Chairman Greenspan, we heard that from Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Yellen. We are on an unsustainable budget path, are the remarks that Fed Chairmen have traditionally shared with us.    As I have raised with previous Chairs, I don't think the American public really understands the magnitude of the problem we are facing. We certainly haven't galvanized the political action necessary to address it.    What do you think we, and what do you think you can do to raise the alarm that the biggest and fastest growing costs in mandatory spending must be addressed?

11426003023	1000	Ranking Member Waters, I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we have always known, as in any sales organization, you're going to have to be diligent, because not every team member will do everything right every day. So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.	Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states. That sales guide reminded employees of what should have been obvious, that they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?    That manual also said that sales practices that showed ``questionable activity'' would be sent via high priority to bank executives. So it appears that you knew something in 2007, that unauthorized accounts were a big enough problem that you had to correct your employee manual.    And, as early as 2008, I have documents from court filings showing your employees were contacting your ethics hotline reporting bank fraud and complaining to managers over unauthorized accounts. And so it looks as if you certainly knew in 2008.    What's more, I have here a consent order with the Fed from 2011 that puts your company on watch for sales quotas and compensation schemes that pushed employees to break the law.

11635589125	101000	Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.    As for what is going to be shared and released on conversations between the President and his foreign partners, the White House ultimately makes those decisions. And so, the inquiries would properly be lodged there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us. Thank you for your service.    March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?

11635589064	1100	So, I think it is important to consider all of these things in the context of the challenges from China. You have seen what we have done with respect to Taiwan. It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, as you know, last Congress I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act, and President Trump signed it into law last March. The intention of this legislation was to allow our high-level officials to go to Taipei and to allow their high-level officials to come here to the United States, including Washington. In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations? And can the people of Taiwan count on you to advocate for further implementation of that I think very important legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act?

11420722045	101000	Congressman, I think the issue, as is usual, doesn't really lend itself well to aphorisms and short statements. And it's my hope that the work of many on this Committee and, indeed, throughout Congress in having the discussion that has begun on this issue will continue so that we can, in fact, continue to work on the serious issues of access to firearms in our society.    Earlier this year, I did make several recommendations to the White House, which were accepted, for important ways for dealing with this issue, ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers, ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities, such as trusts.    But also, as part of that, a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the information and the issues arising out of gun violence, as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy.

11420722043	1	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed. And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?	And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?

11420722029	100000	Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair. That, in and of itself, will go a long way toward restoring faith and trust in the overall criminal justice system, which is also a problem often raised to my attention during my travels.    So the Department looks forward to continuing to support those important efforts.	Thank you for your response.    I would like to ask you in a friendly way how we can--as a Committee, what is it that we can do to address the problem?    And we seek your friendly advice in that direction because we want to work together with all the branches of government, and the House Judiciary Committee is in a very unusually important position to play an important role in this.

11635589098	1001	I will have to look into it.	Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.    In particular, we have seen your Assistant Secretary of State Chris Ford say the Department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of understanding, which do not require congressional oversight or approval, rather than through a one-two-three agreement.    And we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which in normal course are made available to the public, but are, instead, being kept secret, all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.

Last Friday, we read a new report suggesting that Mr. Trump's foreign policy adviser has been meeting with high-ranking, sanctioned officials in Moscow to discuss lifting economic sanctions if Mr. Donald Trump becomes President. The same report quotes, ``a senior United States law enforcement official,'' who says that this relationship is being, ``actively monitored and investigated.''    Is the FBI investigating the activities of Mr. Trump or any adviser to the Trump campaign with respect to any line of communication between the campaign and the Russian Government?

11420722054	1100	Congressman, with respect to the Director's statements, as I've indicated, he's provided really unprecedented access into his views of the matter, and I would refer you to them.    I understand the issue that you raise, obviously, is one involving perceptions as to whether or not charges would have been brought in some other situation. And, again, I can only refer you back to the Director's statements, where he chose to outline the fact that no other cases similar to this had, in fact, been brought.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Madam Attorney General, I think the thing that I find so disheartening, so unfortunate, about FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week was that, for a lot of Americans, it looked like we're seeing a double standard, unequal treatment under the law.    Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.    Now, I assume that, based upon the way you've answered some of my colleague's questions prior to this, you're not going to acknowledge what I think virtually every other American believes, even her supporters, and that's to at least acknowledge, as Director Comey did, that she lied.

We will disagree on why and how.

But I will leave that debate for another day.    I also want to associate myself with the comments made by Mr. Meeks. I would encourage you as well to keep a close eye on the CRA.    I also want to take that and I will expand it a little bit, just a little bit more.

I assume that the Fed would not be interested in an economy that just worked for Texas and didn't work for New York.

Your predecessor, Attorney General Holder, testified in 2013 before the Senate, and this is a direct quote: ``It is inexcusable that young kids, 6, 7 year olds, 14 year olds, have immigration decisions made on their behalf against them and they're not represented by counsel.''    Now, in July of this year, the American Immigration Council and several other organizations filed a class action lawsuit in District Court in the Western District of Washington challenging the validity of removal proceedings for children without appointed counsel. And their argument was that an 8-year-old couldn't receive a full and fair hearing in the immigration court without representation.    As you know, I'm sure, the Administration has made efforts to provide counsel to small children by funding nonprofit groups, but the Assistant Attorney General who argued, I think a Mr. Leon Fresco, actually argued contrary to that in the District Court. And I'm wondering if the Department's position has changed since Mr. Holder left the Department and whether you think it could meet due process to have an 8-year-old who speaks only Spanish appear in immigration court without a lawyer and be able to argue the nuances of immigration law and asylum law.

11497630000	101000	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    With respect to that important issue, as I've indicated, the most important priority of the Department of Justice is the protection of the American people. And, certainly, national security and terrorism are one of my own top priorities and certainly an area of concern for all of us. That is certainly our main concern.    At the same time, we do have a system for allowing not just immigration but refugee entrance into the country. As the FBI Director has noted, there is a process in place that allows for significant vetting of refugees from all countries.	Thank you, General Lynch.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.    Yesterday, a video reportedly linked to ISIS was posted stating that, ``As we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington.''    Now, there is little doubt that ISIS views the United States and the West as a strategic enemy, and there is little doubt that our immigration laws, our lawful immigration laws, have been abused on a number of occasions by people intending to perpetrate harm against the United States.    Do you agree with what your own FBI Director, James Comey, told this Committee regarding the inability to adequately vet and confirm the true identity because of the lack of information, databases, law enforcement resources, intelligence resources, and military resources available to us in Syria of Syrians who have applied for refugee resettlement in the United States?

11426003139	1011	I don't have a precise count of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.    So my question to you, Mr. Stumpf, first is, how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?

11497630027	100000	Mr. Congressman, our discussion about civil rights and the appropriate use of force and all police tactics can only serve to make all of us, the community members and police officers, safer.    In my discussions with police officers around the country, I have found a positive engagement on these issues. I have found them to have some of the best thoughts and best practices to share with other departments on these issues--issues like the best practices for deescalation of certain situations, issues like the best practices for maintaining a relationship with community organizations and citizens councils, issues on police safety. They've provided us valuable input in our program, such as providing bulletproof vests, body-worn cameras. They are focusing on the best ways to use these new technologies.    So, while certainly there may be anecdotal evidence there, as all have noted, there's no data to support it. And what I have seen in my travels across this country is the dedication, the commitment, and the resolve of our brave men and women in law enforcement to improving policing, to embracing the 21st-Century Task Force recommendations, and to continuing to have a dialogue that makes our country safer for all.	Thank you.    In recent weeks, there have been some suggestions, some from within your department, that our dialogue on these issues have somehow reduced the willingness of some police officers to perform their duties.    I know of no real evidence to substantiate this claim, but, in your opinion, does that conversation about civil rights and the appropriate use of force by police somehow make us less safe?

11426003115	100000	Virgin American.	Mr. Chairman, the American people need an assurance that this cross-selling mania that has afflicted Wells Fargo is not to be found at the other big banks. And I would urge you to have hearings where we hear from the CEOs of Bank of America, Citigroup, and others.    And, until then, I hope that you would join with me in a letter of inquiry to ask what new account-opening quotas they had for their bank tellers, how many people they fired for not meeting their quotas, or how many people they fired for opening phony accounts.    We have Wells Fargo before me, but I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience. Your colleagues should at least come forward with some assurance.    We are now engaged in an important national ritual where the CEO comes before the Representatives of the American people to apologize, to take full responsibility, to do so humbly.

11420722157	111000	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.	Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.

11635589003	1000	I do not want to speak about particular troop levels. I will leave that to the Department of Defense. But I can talk about the policy. The President has made clear he wants to put as few American soldiers' lives at risk as he possibly can and do so while achieving America's important policy interests. I think we can do that.    By the way, I have a senior State Department official who is working diligently to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 and to work with the Turks and with the Kurds to create conditions on the ground, in the real estate that separates Syria and Turkey, so that we can continue to maintain the vigilance that led to the destruction of the caliphate.    It is a longer answer, but this fits inside our policy throughout the Middle East, whether it is Iraq or in Syria, the work that we are doing to help Lebanon, the work we are doing with our Gulf partners to achieve precisely what it is I think you describe, a secure situation for the American people and an increase in the stability throughout the Middle East.	I just want you to know that I have here the OIG's email confirming that they have no problems with the Department providing these documents to Congress. It has just been very frustrating, and I am sure you can understand, the stonewalling we have been getting for over a year now. And it is very frustrating. All we want to know is what we are entitled to know. A call from your staff just days before this hearing in which they did not agree to produce any documents is really not a good-faith effort. So, I would hope, based on what you have said, that you will provide us the documents the committee requested, and I hope you can do that within 1 week. There is nothing outlandish or outrageous. We are just trying to do our jobs.    I want to ask you a question about Syria. I am very worried about President Trump's statement that we are going to pull out of Syria. I do not want the United States to be in a foreign country any more than we have to, but pulling out of Syria would be a betrayal to the Kurds, our faithful allies for many, many years; saved American lives. It would create problems for our ally Israel because it would put the Iranian regime right on Israel's border. And if and when we ever had to come back, it would probably result in more American casualties. Right now, we seem to have the situation pretty much in hand.    So, I hope that the President's precipitous statement that we were going to, after he allegedly spoke with Mr. Erdogan of Turkey, that we were going to pull out of Syria soon, immediately, or whatever, is not the truth, is not so, and that we have rethought it. And can you give us some assurances on that?	And can you give us some assurances on that?

The 3-day waiting period is part of congressional action that has already been voted on by Congress.

We are working to improve the NICS system to make it as efficient as possible. We've expanded the number of personnel working on those background checks. We are working also to improve the automated portion of the NICS system so that the dealers who go through the system will be able to get information more quickly and to be able to respond, either by proceeding or denying a sale or in other ways as appropriate.    So we are working within the system as it is currently structured. In order to change that, it would require congressional action.

I think that we have recognized certain rights for those within our borders, certain rights for citizens in varying degrees with respect to the Constitution.

11497630047	110000	Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    This is, indeed, an important issue. Of course, we will always be deeply indebted to those first responders and brave men and women who risked their lives to search for and recover victims, to remove debris at the site, to carry out the recovery efforts at Ground Zero at 9/11.    It certainly is an important issue to me both as Attorney General and as someone who was in New York on 9/11 and who had friends and former colleagues who were in that group of those who were on the scene and who were involved in those activities. This is, in fact, a serious issue for those who were affected by it, and I greatly appreciate your expression of compassion for those who have fallen ill.    With respect to the bill that is currently pending, certainly, on behalf of the Department of Justice, we would do all that we could to work with you to make sure if there were any questions or issues they could be addressed. And we hope that there would be none.    This is, indeed, an important issue. And, again, I think it is something that deserves, certainly, strong review, serious consideration. And please let us know how the Department can be of assistance to any of the Members as they consider this important issue.	I thank the Chairman.    And I thank the Attorney General.    Madam Attorney General, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice established and oversaw a victims' compensation fund that provided more than $7 billion to families who lost loved ones on that day.    In the years after the attacks, it became clear that thousands of first responders and survivors continued to suffer major health consequences from the attacks and their aftermath. Thousands of lawsuits were filed against contractors and others by these victims.    In 2010, Congress enacted the James Zadroga Act, which provided essential healthcare services to those in need and reopened the Victim Compensation Fund to those families whose losses became apparent after September 11, providing them an alternative to litigation. In the last 5 years, the Victim Compensation Fund has provided nearly 6,300 first responders and survivors with $1.4 billion in compensation determinations. Since we enacted the bill, I am aware of no further 9/11-related lawsuits.    Despite its current success, on September 30, 2015, Congress allowed the VCF and the World Trade Center Health Program to expire. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in the House to permanently reauthorize the Victim Compensation Fund and the World Trade Center Health Program. The bill now has the cosponsorship of 247 cosponsors, a majority of the House, including more than 50 Republicans, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 65 cosponsors.    If Congress fails to act, thousands of first responders and survivors will lose access to compensation on which they depend to support their families when they are tragically gone. The VCF is preparing to shutter its operations once it has processed existing claims. If the VCF is not fully funded and reauthorized, the first responders and survivors who have already received the notice of their compensation could actually see that amount cut by up to 50 percent.    We are literally talking about taking money out of the hands of a sick police officer. I am deeply saddened to think that is how Congress plans to remember the heroes of 9/11.    Attorney General Lynch, do you agree that this is not the proper way to honor the heroes of 9/11?

11420722107	101000	Well, thank you for raising this important issue, Congressman. I think that the issue of the training that we at the Department of Justice provide for law enforcement as well as the training generated in the field is of utmost importance. And I will tell you that as I have, in fact, traveled the country on my community policing tour highlighting departments that are working on this very issue, I've seen some outstanding examples, in particular, of de-escalation training using various scenarios to start, literally, with the mindset of the officer and how they respond to certain situations.    I have also been extremely encouraged by seeing law enforcement comment on many of the recent incidents that have been captured on video and talk about how training would or would not relate to those specific incidents. And I've been incredibly heartened by the growing sense of importance this issue has taken on within law enforcement itself. We have seen a number of, as I mentioned, of very, very positive programs involving training. We have seen, as I mentioned, not just the de-escalation but also training in the issues about the definitions of excessive force, the legal standards for excessive force. I have seen programs that break that down for officers, where we have seen----	Thank you very much. Last week, we saw more disturbing videos of police shooting of African-Americans, and we saw police officers killed in Dallas. And that was dreadful. The other side has made a point, my friends, to say people should know that nobody is above the law and all people are treated equally. Unfortunately, what we have seen is that African-Americans are not treated equally when it comes to deadly force and police officers in this country. And that's a more chilling reality than anything else that's been brought up here today. People's lives have been taken. This is a great problem. Black lives matter.    Congressman Lacy Clay and I put forward a bill last year, the Police Training and Independent Review Act, H.R. 2302, to address two of the major issues that have been identified as necessary to help improve the relationship of police and citizens. The bill would withhold a portion of Federal funding unless police are trained on a range of important issues like racial and ethnic bias and cultural diversity. I know the DOJ recently announced it would train all its office agents to recognize implicit bias, so I know you are aware of the need of training.    Our bill would also withhold a portion of Federal funding, unless police shootings that result in a death or injury are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted independently. Asking a local prosecutor to investigate the same law enforcement agency they work with and provide them with witnesses is implicitly wrong. Like Caesar's wife, an individual should be a prosecutor beyond the appearance of impropriety. If a prosecutor does everything right, the action can still appear biased.    If we are serious about restoring the sense of trust that we need to have with our citizenry, we need to eliminate this conflict of interest. As I know, as you've mentioned, a key part of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing calls for independent prosecutors. Campaign Zero, gaining a lot of credibility, also has called for the passage of this act. Congressman Clay and I have seen a surge of support. We now have 77 cosponsors. It has been endorsed by an unlikely a team maybe as the NAACP and the Chicago Tribune.

Sir, I need to move on. I take that as a yes.

Not only does this open the door to special treatment for industry over the public health, but you could also pick winners and losers amongst the industry types.

11532380055	100000	I did chair that meeting.	Thank you.    Now, I want to show you an image from March 31, 2016, of a meeting of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee, which you chaired, with yourself in attendance, along with then-candidate Donald Trump and Mr. George Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos pled guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI.    The charging papers filed by Special Counsel Mueller describe the March 31 meeting, where Mr. Papadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could help arrange a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to communicate with the Russian Government on behalf of the Trump campaign and appears to have told several senior campaign officials about it.    Now, here is the problem. On October 18 of this year, you said under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, quote, ``A continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian Government did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.''    Senator Franken asked, ``You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?'', to which you responded, ``I did not, and I'm not aware of anyone else that did,'' unquote.    Now, we now know that, one, the campaign had communications with the Russians through Mr. Papadopoulos and others, and, two, you seem to have been aware of the fact at the time. So let's try and correct the earlier testimony now for the record.    ``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?	``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?

Mr. Smith informs Mr. Luetkemeyer what he is implying in the question is not completely correct. He answers that there are limits to coverage but answers the question. Witness answered question, but didn't want to say the company is covered because the consumers are not. Witness says their are limits to their protection but does not disclose them. Smith states that the insurance does have limitations. He adds that he has ""not disclosed those limits."""

11426003075	1110	Well, thank you, Congressman.    The culture of the company is strong. And I don't--I know--	So I want you to think about that culture. Because what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina. It doesn't conform to what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis. I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina; we're grateful for it. But what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina.    I wanted to look at your code of conduct that you tout. So let's look at your code of ethics and business conduct. You said in your message as CEO, ``We are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards in how we conduct our business and serve our customers.''    The code of ethics, in fact, says, ``Our code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo and Company and its subsidiaries.'' It also says, ``We are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws.'' And, finally, ``It's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our company's code of ethics and business conduct and understanding that noncompliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.''    You clearly have failed. You've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally. You have broken, and your company has broken, longstanding law. You've broken longstanding ethical standards that you have within your company. This has nothing to do with this debate about Dodd-Frank or anything else. You've broken a longstanding law, and you've defrauded your customers.    How can you rebuild trust? And how can you get through this thing?

And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy.

The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.

And I feel if a vote was allowed on the floor, there would be enough like-minded Republicans that would vote, as we did on the Violence Against Women Act and other areas, jointly in a bipartisan way to open up our government.

Well, I think we should, and I think, Mr. Chairman, we should make that request formal in terms of our committee, if not for the whole membership of the House.    Yesterday, I had a hearing here in our Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia. And as part of that hearing, we dealt with the historic 70-year alliance that we had with Europe, one of the most successful alliances in modern history, if not the history of Europe itself.    And one of the things that came across to me in a recent trip there about three and a half weeks ago was the concern with the officials there. Let me give you one example that really was difficult for me to address when I was asked. The EU officials that we met with, they used words like ``painful'' and ``hurtful,'' and they meant it sincerely, when they were talking about how they felt from actions of the United States.    And one thing they said, in particular, was that the emergency security powers that we used to assess the tariffs that were there struck them, because they asked the question, ``You are using emergency security powers to create tariffs on our closest allies.'' And they were asking us--and maybe you could help us with this--when did they become a security risk to the United States?

11422125099	110000	That is a very hard decision. That is why it is the exception to the rule. You do risk damaging someone who isn't convicted.    The judgment I made in this case is, given the unusual--in fact, I hope unprecedented--nature of this investigation, that it was appropriate to offer that transparency. Not an easy call. I really wrestled with it, but I think, on balance, it was the right call.	Okay.    My final question is the following. You investigated Secretary Clinton's emails and so forth, everything we have been talking about. You concluded, I believe quite properly, there was nothing to prosecute. And you have announced, in my opinion quite properly, that you had investigated it and there was nothing there--or there was nothing to prosecute. That was proper.    But having announced--when a prosecutorial agency announces that ``we have investigated so-and-so and we have decided to prosecute because'' or ``we have investigated so-and-so and we have decided not to prosecute because,'' why is it appropriate for that prosecutorial agency to go further and say, ``Even though we decided not to prosecute, we still think this person did this, that, or the other thing and it was proper or improper''?

We know that the former Director of the FBI testified to the House Intelligence Committee in open hearing that there was an active investigation into the associates of the Trump campaign, and he was fired subsequently. Mr. Mueller was then hired. Investigations have secured numerous indictments, convictions, or guilty pleas, and, of course, a deal with perjury charges like obstruction of justice, perjury, false statements. So, at the current rate, we are seeing so many of the Trump organizations being indicted, and with the short time that I have, I want to make sure that your questions are answered in a yes-or-no manner.

That was even shut down--	It was in a different business area, but I will read from the consent order: ``Wells Fargo's internal controls were not adequate to detect and prevent instances when certain of its sales personnel, in order to meet sales performance standards and receive incentive compensation, altered or falsified income documents and inflated prospective borrowers' incomes to qualify those borrowers for loans that they would not otherwise have been qualified to receive.''

We have not made a decision in the longer run whether that will continue to be our framework or whether we will return to something more like what we did before the crisis.    I don't have a schedule for--I don't expect to be returning to that decision in the near term. I would just say that our current approach seems to be working very well. It gives us control over rates, and the market seems to understand it.	Thank you, Chairman Powell.    The Chair now yields to himself for 5 minutes.

We have to place it in the context of our larger policy, Indo-Pacific policy, even more broadly. We are trying to make sure that we get each of these steps right.    What President Trump has directed each of us to do is recognize facts on the ground, try to apply good common sense, and then, generate policies that actually get outcomes. I think for an awful long time, we have done things that made us feel good, but did not deliver. And so, with respect to this particular issue, and all the issues that surround it in Asia, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people. And so, as we consider the appropriateness of a lot of decisions on designations, on sanctions, on how the Department of Defense is going to posture, how we work with Southeastern countries, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people.

11497630098	110000	I have not reviewed that specific IG's report. What I can tell you is that the prosecution and apprehension of individuals at the border is one to which not just the Department, but the specific U.S. attorneys in those border States devote significant time and attention. And steps are taken at the initial level to try and ensure that those who are seeking asylum are handled appropriately and that those who are coming in for other intents and purposes are handled through the immigration law system and often the criminal law system.	Let me ask you this. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General has done an analysis of--we have many people from Central America in particular who are seeking asylum. And what he reports, that there is a review called Operation Streamline that found that the Department of Justice has actually prosecuted asylum seekers for illegal entry before their asylum case is heard.    And it seems to me that while not only does that violate the requirements of international law, but it doesn't seem like an efficient use of resources.

There are two thoughts there: One, the rise and the intensity and severity of cybersecurity incidents around the country and the world is running at a pace that has never been seen before. And I am convinced there is more we can do in public-private partnership to get ahead of the curve on cybersecurity, not just reacting to it.    Number two is, the more I reflect, think, and talk to experts in the area of cybersecurity, I am convinced there is an opportunity for this partnership between public and private to rethink the concept of a Social Security number, name, date of birth as being the most secure way to identify consumers in the U.S.    It is an instrument that was introduced, as you well know far better than I, back in the 1930s.

So you'd have to refer to the specific facts of the other matters that you're referring to.    With respect to the investigation into the former Secretary's handling of classified information, her private email system, again, I can tell you and this entire Committee and the American people that all of the relevant facts were considered, investigated thoroughly, and reviewed by the entire team, which, again, is composed of career independent investigators as well as lawyers. And their recommendation, upon a full and thorough analysis, was that the matter be resolved in the way in which it was recommended to me.    As I've indicated, I determined to accept that recommendation and did, in fact, accept that recommendation.	I have a limited amount of time.    You know, the fact is that, whether it's extremely careless or gross negligence and a strict liability of statute, I think that the language of the statute is clear.    Now, I've noted that the Justice Department over the last several years has prosecuted several servicemen for doing the exact same thing that Secretary Clinton did and, in one case, actually reached a judgment of a court that prohibited that serviceman from ever having a security classification again.    Now, you have a problem, Madam Attorney General, that people think that there's a different standard between the servicemen and Secretary Clinton and the fact that the language is almost synonymous, if not synonymous, saying no prosecution of Secretary Clinton and prosecution and conviction of the servicemen.    You have a burden, I think, to convince the American public that you don't have a double standard. You're not meeting the burden. And how do you plan to change the argument that you make to the American public so that they can be convinced that the thing was correct and that you made the right decision, rather than simply deferring to people in the FBI and the prosecutors?

11531349017	100000	Thank you, Ranking Member Waters. I have been involved. This is the seventh process to select a reserve bank president that I have been involved in since I joined the Fed in 2012, so I am very familiar with the way the process works.    We always insist that the search committee, which consists of the B and C directors of the Reserve Bank, hire a national search firm. We always insist--and they don't need to be pushed into this, this is something they want to do--we always insist that there is a highly diverse candidate pool and that diverse candidates are given serious consideration and every chance to become the successful participant in that process.    I can absolutely guarantee you that that will continue to be the case. We will always have diverse candidates. They will always have a fair shot.    I cannot in any individual case guarantee that there will be a diverse outcome, but I can guarantee that the process will be working in that direction.	Thank you very much.    Chairman Powell, with a permanent voting seat on the FOMC, and its role in supervising some of the largest and most complex financial institutions in the country, the president of the New York Federal Reserve has one of the most important economic policymaking roles in the Nation.    Bill Dudley will step down this year. The search for his replacement is under way. Historically, the New York Fed's close proximity to Wall Street has led to the selection of an individual with close ties to the financial sector.    In your view, how important is it that the individual chosen is a diverse candidate, with demonstrated independence from Wall Street and a strong commitment to the Fed's maximum employment mandate and regulatory responsibilities?    What steps is the board taking to ensure that candidates from diverse gender, racial, and ethnic backgrounds are given due consideration? If diverse candidates are not afforded due consideration, are you prepared to exercise your power as Chair to reject such candidates to serve as the next president of the New York Fed?    I know you have a lot on your plate, but I have to put this question to you because we have to do better about diversity, in particular at the highest levels. Not only am I looking at what is happening with the New York Fed and the possibility there, but we have to look at our own Fed, and think about how diverse is it at the top levels, management levels.

Mr. Administrator, you are not the first person to be the victim of, for lack of a better term, Washington politics. You got picked to be the EPA Administrator because of the service you provided for the great State of Oklahoma in fighting some of the Obama administration radical clean air policies. You recommended and I support the recommendation that you made to the President that we withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement. That is a decision that most of the stakeholders at EPA violently oppose.    If you can't debate the policies in Washington, you attack the personality and that is what is happening to you. Republicans do it when it is a Democratic President. The Democrats do it when it is a Republican President. And in my opinion, and it is just my opinion, that is what is happening to you.

11637282134	101000	No. There's a couple other rules. First of all, even though you run every two years--the President declared the day he got elected that he's going to be running again. We did not deem him a candidate until later.    So even though you're running every 2 years, if you choose, there's a date that we take from when you're actually, like, a declared candidate. So that's No. 1.    No. 2, as I indicated, absolutely, as an adviser of the President, you can comment on policies. However, when you ask me about--talk about Democrats and people are running potentially for office, it gets a little bit closer, which is why we have a very robust advisory function.

11531349044	101000	I do think our post-crisis policies were effective. I haven't carefully studied that report yet, but let me say that what these reports try to do is they try to identify the surprise element in a particular Fed announcement and isolate that from what was already priced into the market.    Most things that happen on announcement day are already priced in. It is very hard to isolate that surprise element. This paper takes a different way of doing that, and it comes up with the answer that comes in.    Overwhelmingly, studies of the effects of asset purchase programs suggest that asset purchase programs did their job, which was to create downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through the term premium. I would say that that is very likely the case.	Last, Chairman Powell, last week, several academics published a paper claiming that the Fed's quantitative easing programs during the Great Recession were largely ineffective at stimulating the economy.

11531504107	101000	If they provide the data and methodology to the Agency and the findings, it will be used.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Pruitt's ethical violations as the head of an Agency with a mission to protect the public's health demonstrate a concerning lack of integrity and a pattern of the rich and powerful putting their rich and powerful friends and their own self-interest above the interest of the public's health and at the expense of the common good. Clean air to breathe and safe water to drink is not a privilege only for the rich and powerful but a right for everyone, and the role of a public servant is to serve and protect the public, in particular the public's health.    However, the gross elimination of many public health protections are kickbacks to the rich lobbyists and corporation friends that have a real impact and I want to highlight one example. This week the EPA announced that it intends to limit the kind of scientific studies it will use in issuing new protections to only studies that make public the private, personal, confidential information of the people who participate in those studies.    Revealing that info is a clear ethical violation of any reputable research institutional review board in the United States. The type of studies you want to exclude are the same kind of scientific studies that were used to prove that lead in pipes and paints harm children and that secondhand smoke is a dangerous carcinogen. We are talking about landmark studies such as the Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study which proved a connection between air pollution and early death back in 1993. That just by living in a city with poor air quality your average life expectancy was lower than those who didn't. This study later became the basis of fine particulate matter regulations in the Clean Air Act.    When you were here in December, you and I spoke about fine particle matter which, thanks to studies based on confidential patient health information, we now know is associated with premature death, asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and respiratory diseases. You acknowledge these risks and agree that there is no safe level of fine particle pollution, but your new policy would block EPA from considering the studies that have shown these dangerous health implications.    So do you deny now that fine particle pollution has these health impacts, and will these new regulations cause your Agency to disregard these sentinel studies?

11497630042	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    We fully support the Judicial Redress Act. And I actually would like to thank you and the other Members of this Committee for the important work that you've done on this issue.    As you have noted, this legislation is critical to continued law enforcement sharing of information from the U.S. and the European Union. In fact, I have been involved in discussions with ministers from the European Union on the Data Protection Act, often called the Umbrella Act, as well as the Judicial Redress Act.    It certainly is our view that this important legislation should be passed. It would provide, as you know, redress for European Union citizens should there be an unauthorized or misuse of their data here in the U.S., which is a privilege enjoyed by U.S. citizens within the European Union.    Without this, we do have a grave risk of not having the completion of the data protection or umbrella agreement. And I think, sadly, recent events have shown us the importance, the critical nature, of making sure that we have these safe and secure portals for transferring information from one law enforcement entity to another.	Okay.    Let me ask one question on an unrelated matter. As you may know, the House, last month, passed a bill called the Judicial Redress Act, which, in my opinion, is essential to enforcing an umbrella agreement to transfer law enforcement information from certain European countries to the United States and vice versa.    If the Senate fails to pass this bill, in your opinion, what will be the effect on the sharing of law enforcement data with certain of our European allies?

11530242056	100000	Congressman, I can reassure you that we took a lot of time to think about the notification process. I will make one point of clarification. On the 24th, the knowledge we had surrounding the breach was still fluid. It was fluid through the 7th. In fact, it was fluid--the forensics did not conclude until Monday of this week.    The other thing I will say is that Mandiant, the cybersecurity forensic experts, recommended that we really prepare ourselves for significant increase, cyber attacks, when you went live with an announcement.    So between the 24th and the 7th, a lot of energy was spent securing wherever we could secure our facilities to give us the best protection against cyber attacks. And also, as you mentioned, Congressman, we had to standup the environment call centers, train people, staff people, pull together the product, the service offering, so a lot of work was being done over those 2 weeks.	The Chairman did a good job of discussing the notification problems with regards to this situation. Can you tell me, what do you believe is a better way to notify the individuals? A minute ago you said you basically knew on the 24th that individual data had been breached, and it wasn't until the 7th, which is 2 weeks later, that you really made a notification to the individuals.    Even if you can't get your systems up and running so you can take phone calls, don't you think it would be better to have at least notified the individuals, if not by just a public declaration saying, hey, we have been breached, millions of people's information could have been breached; therefore, all of you who are in our systems need to take precautions and let them on their own take whatever precautions they can rather than wait to find out if they had been hacked or if their information has been breached?

11636001113	110000	Congressman, absolutely there is a connection between the drugs that are being imported through our southern border, which is a large majority of those drugs, and the opioid crisis we now face. In fact, I went to China in August as chief of staff for then General Sessions. He asked me to go to talk to the Chinese about what more they could do to reduce the amount of fentanyl that is being produced in China, and we had a nice dialogue with some high-level government officials. And the President, as you know, has agreed with General Xi to reduce fentanyl and eliminate fentanyl production in China. And one of the ways that China has agreed to do that was by scheduling the analogs of fentanyl. It is a very serious problem, and I know Ohio is dramatically affected by it.

But another area, Mr. Chairman, that I know you have been interested in is high octane. And with respect to--it was mentioned in some other comments about the CAFE standards. There needs to be a serious consideration of us pursuing as a country fuel choices and options to meet those CAFE standards and provide high octane as an option to the American people. I think there is a potential that will serve both the ag sector as well at the auto sector and consumers across this country that we could pursue together.

11426003105	100000	At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.    In the time remaining, let's get to the securities questions. The Securities Exchange Act requires a public company to keep its disclosure in place--that's under SOX--requires the CEO and the CFO to attest to financial statements.

11530956102	100000	Yes, Congressman. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify that.    So one of the questions is, what information do we track and why about people who are not signed into Facebook? We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. For security, it is to make sure that people who are not signed into Facebook can't scrape people's public information.    You can--even when you are not signed in, you can look up the information that people have chosen to make public on their page because they wanted to share it with everyone, so there is no reason why you should have to be logged in.    But, nonetheless, we don't want someone to be able to go through and download every single public piece of information. Even if someone chose to make it public, that doesn't mean that it is good to allow someone to aggregate it. So, even if someone isn't logged in, we track certain information, like how many pages they are accessing, as a security measure.    The second thing that we do is we provide an ad network that third-party websites and apps can run in order to help them make money. And those ads, similar to what Google does and what the rest of the industry does, it is not limited to people who are just on Facebook. So, for the purposes of that, we may also collect information to make it so that those ads are more relevant and work better on those websites.    There is a control that for that second class of information or an ad targeting anyone can turn off, has complete control over it. For obvious reasons, we do not allow people to turn off the measurement that we do around security.	Clarify and have more confidence.

They are a significant part of the arsenal that every Federal prosecutor utilizes.    Most recently, I've convened a summit with the top elected officials, police chiefs, and leaders of major cities to talk about violent crime that's currently taking place in several major cities, with a focus on finding the causes and finding the best ways to direct Federal resources to those particular cities.	Then why aren't they being prosecuted for those violations related to firearms?    And, by the way, this doesn't just mean using a firearm in the commission of crime. It also means illegal sales of firearms. It means lying on the Instant Check System of which, for the last year for which we have complete data, 76,000 people were found to have committed the felony of swearing to false information on that form. Five thousand were referred for prosecution, but the 94 U.S. attorneys' offices across the country could only find time to prosecute 62 out of 76,000.    So somebody going into a gun store to buy a weapon knows that, even if they're caught--and often they're not caught because the system doesn't have all the information it needs in it--but even if they're caught, they often find that the odds are one in a thousand that they'll be prosecuted even when they're caught.    What are you doing about that? What should be done about it? And why has this decline been so precipitous over the last several years?

11635230127	101000	I don't expect I'm going to have a source of income when I'm in Federal penitentiary.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Jordan.    The chairman and this committee have promised members of the American people a fair and open process, yet the Democrats have vastly limited the scope of this hearing. They issued a gag order to try to tell members of this committee what we can and cannot talk about.    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that they want the truth, that they want transparency and fair oversight, yet the Democrats' witness to testify before Congress today is none other than a scorned man who is going to prison for lying to Congress.    Let that sink in. He is going to prison for lying to Congress, and he is the star witness to Congress.    If you read the sentencing report on Mr. Cohen words like ``deceptive'' and ``greedy'' are scattered throughout that report. It paints a picture of a narcissist, a bully who cannot tell the truth, whether it is about the President or about his own personal life. But today he is the majority party's star witness.    If the Democrats were after the truth, they'd have an honest person here testifying. And if they were really after the truth, they'd not restrict the questioning to just a few topics. But let's take a look at those restricted topics.    Mr. Chairman, the first topic in your limited scope that I can ask Mr. Cohen is about the President's debts. But, Mr. Chairman, didn't Mr. Cohen plead guilty to lying to banks about his personal finances? So we are asking a guy going to jail for lying about his debts to comment about the President's debts. He is the expert.    Mr. Chairman, your next couple of topics say that I can ask Mr. Cohen about the President's compliance with financial disclosures and campaign finance laws. But didn't Mr. Cohen on two occasions break campaign finance law with his own donations? So again, the majority party's star witness on the President's compliance is a guy who broke compliance laws himself.    Mr. Chairman, you graciously allow us to ask questions of Mr. Cohen on the President's dealings with the IRS and tax law. Your star witness here broke the law with regards to the IRS at least five times. He pled guilty on cheating on his taxes, lying to the IRS. He's the best witness you got?    Next up, with the permission of the chairman I get to ask Mr. Cohen about his perspective on the President's business dealings. Let me get this straight. The witness lied to multiple financial institutions to get loans to pay off other loans just to keep himself afloat, and he is going to be the expert on business practices.    Obviously, Mr. Chairman, the witness may produce documents that he suggests incriminates the President, yet he lies to banks. All of those lies were done on fraudulent documents, documents that he forged. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. Apparently he even lied about delivering his own child, which his wife had to correct the record.    Ladies and gentlemen, how on earth is this witness credible? With all the lies and deception, the self-serving fraud, it begs the question, what is the majority party doing here? No one can see this guy as credible. He will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. He is a fake witness, and his presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people see through this. I know the people back in Tennessee will.    And with that statement, sir, I have a few questions for the witness.

11531349065	100100	Thank you, Mr. Royce. Of course we don't do fiscal policy at the Fed, but I will accept your invitation and just say that it is very important that the Federal Government and government generally be on a sustainable fiscal path, meaning as the baby boomer generation retires, we will need to address the significant fiscal issues that are coming to us over time. I think it is important that Congress do that.    At the same time, the debt ceiling should be something that we always raise in a timely fashion. There is no other country in the world that has a separate vote over whether to pay bills that we have already agreed to incur. I think the United States has never defaulted on a principal or interest payment and never should.    I think doing so would be something I would really hate to see and could bring very significant consequences.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being with us here today. I also wanted to thank you for another effort you undertook, and that was in 2011. You spent a considerable amount of time with members of the House, trying to walk them through the debate that we had on raising the debt ceiling.    You were trying to get us focused on all the unintended consequences, which would occur if we did not raise that debt ceiling, and I very much appreciated the time, effort, and facts that you put forward.    You have a new voice now at the Fed. I assume your opinions on the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling remain. I know that in August, it looks as though the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, or have to roll over, $500 billion of debt in August.    If we are in a quasi-default situation in August, then clearly it is a real question as who would want to purchase that debt and at what cost would they purchase that debt? Clearly a premium on that, a 10 percent premium, it would be a $50 billion hit right there to the interest expense, but there is much more than that that would befall the impact on our markets and, frankly, at corporate debt.    Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?	Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?

11497630036	101000	Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    What I would say on this issue certainly is, as the Administration has stated, the closure of Guantanamo Bay is something that is part of the Administration's policy, and the Department of Justice supports that, as well.    At this point in time, I believe the current state of the law is that individuals are not transferred from Guantanamo to U.S. shores. That position is reiterated by the legislation that you mention. And my understanding, as you indicated, is that I do believe the President has indicated that he would sign that.    And, certainly, it's the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard to that issue.	Thank you very much.    Madam Attorney General, welcome. We hope to be seeing you for a bit, at least for the next 14 months.    I have a question relative to the issue of the Guantanamo detainees. Congress recently passed and the President is expected to sign into law legislation that explicitly prohibits the use of Federal funds to move detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States.

Renewable transactions--according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), globally the United States and other export credit agencies can extend loans as long as 18 years.    And in fact, Jim Rogers, former chairman of Duke Energy, said just recently that we need export credit agencies essentially to finance power projects, conventional and renewable, because banks will only lend for 5 to 7 years. So we provide a longer term to make sure this capital equipment can be paid off.	Again, please accept my sincerest apologies for the slander.

11635589121	100000	So, I have spoken to my Russian counterpart no less than three times on the issue of Venezuela and their interference, the fact that they are undermining Venezuelan democracy. It was met with precisely what you would expect from them.    We are doing our level best to push back against the capacity of Cuba, who has had intelligence officers and security officers on the ground there today protecting Maduro. It shocks me that the Venezuelan military will tolerate these foreigners, right, coming to run their security service. As a former U.S. Army officer, it would have been embarrassing if a third country had to come in and provide security for the leadership of our country. But that is where we are today.    We are doing our level best to put sanctions in place, to put restrictions in place, and to, more importantly, build our coalition, not just in South America and Central America with the OAS and the Lima Group, but European countries from all the around the world who understand that democratic Venezuela is the only path forward and Maduro has to go before we can get there.	And I am going to give a shoutout to you because I had the opportunity to travel with you for a better part of a day. What I saw you and your team doing I thought was pretty phenomenal, because I have never seen this done before where you were traveling within the States to promote what the State Department does. You were talking to young students to get them involved in thinking about going into a career in the State Department. And I commend you and your team for doing that, because I look back when I grew up as a pretty sheltered life. I did not even think that was a realm of possibility. Again, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that.    I share the same beliefs as Mr. Sires, of my colleague, in regards to Russia, Cuba, China, and Iran, that there is maybe a destabilizing, coordinated effort underway to destabilize the Western Hemisphere. And I think you and I have talked about this, that Venezuela could be but the rubicon, because if Venezuela fails, it will show that Cuba, you know, they cannot survive because they are the ones that have been propping that up.    How do you assess that? And along with that, how should we respond to Russia's interference under the guise of support to the Maduro regime in Venezuela?

11497630025	100000	Thank you, Congressman Conyers.    This is, in fact, one of my top priorities as Attorney General. And I'm incredibly proud to say that the Department of Justice has already begun the type of outreach that I was discussing at that particular event.    Through our COPS Office, in particular, the Community-Oriented Policing Service Office, we reach out directly to police departments across the country and offer technical assistance, we offer training, we offer peer-to-peer support.    We have found that an incredibly effective way to share information within the law enforcement community is peer-to-peer, police-officer-to-police-officer, chief-to-chief. And so we work with the departments that have, in fact, made great strides in the area of police-community relations and seek to match them up with other departments who are having challenges in this area and who would be receptive to their input.    I also, as I noted in my opening statement, have been on a six-city community policing tour. And as I talk with residents, with young people, elected leaders, I also talk with police officers. I do meet with chiefs and supervisors, but I also talk to the rank-and-file, the officers who are on the beats of our cities, to get their ideas as to what has worked in their city, as to why a positive relationship has developed in the cities where they have had challenges and where they have had struggles.    I have listened to their stories of commitment and dedication and to their embrace of community policing and concern for residents as a program and policy that makes policing more efficient and that makes communities safer. And I'm incredibly proud to support those efforts.	Thank you very much, Chairman Goodlatte.    Attorney General Lynch, I want to thank you again for speaking at my panel at this year's Congressional Black Caucus Legislative Forum. It was marvelous.    At that event, you spoke about the breakdown in trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. You also spoke about getting to the root of the problem with a comprehensive approach to training, to policy, and to research.    Many of the law enforcement officers in attendance agreed with your comments. How are you planning on reaching out to the broader law enforcement community to promote these ideas?
