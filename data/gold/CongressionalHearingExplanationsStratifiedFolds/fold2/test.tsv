11530956094	100100	Congressman, this is an important question to clarify. So, in 2007, we launched the platform in order to make it so that people could sign into other apps, bring some of their information and some of their friends' information to have social experiences.    This created a lot of innovative experiences, new games, companies like Zynga. There were companies that you are familiar with like Netflix and Spotify had integrations with this that allowed social experiences in their apps. But, unfortunately, there were also a number of apps that used this for abuse, to collect people's data.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here, Mr. Zuckerberg.    Two things: First of all, I want to thank Facebook. You streamlined our congressional baseball game last year. We have got the managers here. And I was told that, because of that, we raised an additional $100,000 for DC literacy and feeding kids and stuff, so that is----    The other thing is, I usually put my stuff up on the TV. I don't want to do it very much because it is my dad, and he would be mad if he went international like you are. And he has been on Facebook for a long time. He is 88. It has been good for connecting with kids and grandkids.    I just got my mother involved on an iPad and--because she can't handle a keyboard. And so--and I did this last week. So, in the swirl of activity, I still think there is a positive benefit for my parents to be engaged on this platform.

11530956018	1100	Congressman, what we allow with our developer platform is for people to choose to sign into other apps and bring their data with them. That is something that a lot of people want to be able to do.    The reason why we built the developer platform in the first place was because we thought it would be great if more experiences that people had could be more social. So, if you could have a calendar that showed your friends' birthdays, if you could have an address book that had pictures of your friends in it, if you could have a map that showed your friends' addresses on it.    In order to do that, you need to be able to sign into an app, bring some of your data and some of your friends' data, and that is what we built. Now, since then, we have recognized that that can be used for abuse too, so we have limited it so now people can only bring their data when they go to an app.    But that is something that a lot of people do on a day-to-day basis is sign into apps and websites with Facebook, and that is something that we are going----	All right. Now, you said yesterday that each of us owns the content that we put on Facebook and that Facebook gives some control to consumers over their content, but we know about the problems with Cambridge Analytica.

11497630038	100100	Well, Mr. Congressman, I'm actually not familiar enough with Mr. Craig's analysis to comment on that. So I'm not able to comment on his views about the statute.

And so I believe that it is the view of the Department that we would certainly observe the laws as passed by Congress and signed by the President. Only very rarely would we take the step of finding that an unconstitutional provision was something that we could not manage. We would, of course, seek to work with Congress and the Administration to resolve that issue.

But I believe the death penalty, the Federal death penalty, is a part of our law. I think it's a legitimate penalty. It's constitutional. And we will do our duty, even in those circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty.	Okay. It seems to me that there's always been a tremendous amount of gray area in that whole field, which I think, as a Nation, you know, we need to look much more closely at, both from the State's point of view and the Federal Government point of view. But that's just my feeling on that.    I'm running out of time. I had about four other things, but let me just go to one final thing here.    I've been very involved in the area of victims' rights. I was the--following Henry Hyde's leadership on this, introduced a victims' rights constitutional amendment years back, various pieces of legislation on victims' rights. And I've also worked closely with the parents of murdered children. And when you talk about something that affects one's family, there's nothing that affects a family more adversely than something like that happening.    And we still have capital punishment on the books, both at the Federal level and many of our States. Yet these families are dragged left and right, up and down, back and forth, into hearing after hearing. These cases can drag on for more than 20 years before the imposition of capital punishment actually occurs. And, in many instances, obviously, it never does.    And while these people are behind bars, oftentimes they attack, sometimes kill guards, attack, sometimes kill other inmates.

The budget should provide the secretary with the necessary means but, I think he avoids answering the actual question asked due to the senator adding ""presidents"" in the budget question.

11531349031	100100	Flattening of yield curves in the past has been a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold inflation down.    That is not the situation we have now. It is very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up, as the economy strengthens. I don't see a particularly large--there is always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.	If I could point out a possible risk that is out there and have you react to it that was created by the unconventional monetary policy. Some have blamed the Fed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by producing an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates exceeded long-term rates.    At the beginning of 2011, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was almost 3 percent. But as of February of this year, that same spread has been whittled down to a mere 0.5 percent, and this is a 450 percent drop. Given a flattening yield curve, and economic conditions that you can see, call for raising the Fed funds rate, how will the Fed avoid another inverted yield curve?    Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer-term assets more quickly to counteract that flattening yield curve?

11389598012	100000	What is correct is that each employee is limited to basically now 6,000 emails that they can hold on their email account which is stored on the agency's server.    The reason there is a limitation is the agency does not have servers large enough to sustain the retention of all emails. A decision was made 2 years ago when people looked at that and it was determined it would cost anywhere from $10 million to $30 million to upgrade the system so that, in fact, all emails on the server would be preserved. Because of the budget constraints the agency was operating with 2 years ago, the decision was made not to proceed.	Well, what is correct?	Well, what is correct?

11525545000	100000	Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.	Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.    The chair reminds Members they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the order of arrival, and I appreciate Members' understanding.    And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Secretary, again, thanks for being here, and we are looking forward to working with you across the myriad of issues that we have, going forward. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I represent a lot of cotton farmers. I believe we had a very elegant fix to the issue with respect to cotton, to the STAX program, that didn't work. It should have been in the omnibus bill, but our colleagues, particularly two of them in the Senate, refused to see the wisdom of that, and for their own purposes and own benefit, didn't let that happen. Now we are left with the same wreck in cotton. I hope I can count on working with you across whatever tools that we have.

11532380042	101000	Well, we can. And the constitutional rights of Americans should be protected. And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.    I know the committee has decided to put some additional restrictions on the way the act is conducted. We did not think that was lawfully required. Congress can make its own decisions, and we will continue to be able to share our thoughts about how the legislation should be crafted.	Thank you very much.    Welcome, Mr. Attorney General.    We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise? Can't we allow the intelligence community to stop terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans?

11497630029	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    With respect to the Department's enforcement of our various civil rights statutes, it is certainly robust and will continue to be so. While we no longer have the advantage of the preclearance provisions that were in the Voting Rights Act, we still have significant provisions of the Voting Rights Act that allow us to review actions and decisions taken, albeit after the fact, to determine whether there has been either a discriminatory intent or, as is very often the case, a discriminatory result.    We can engage in negotiation and conversations. Many times, we do that before we even move to litigation in an attempt to reason with or have a discussion with entities that are making significant changes. And often those discussions are very productive. I was pleased to see that, after discussions with Members of Congress, the State of Alabama may be making some modifications to those changes. And, certainly, those types of discussions are an efficient way to bring about change and raise these important issues.    But I will reiterate, Congressman, that the Department of Justice is committed to enforcing the civil rights laws that we do have on the books. And we are committed to a vigorous review of matters that are brought to our attention and will ensure full and fair and efficient review of those matters and take the action that is appropriate.	Thank you.    The State of Alabama's plan to close 31 driver's license offices demonstrates how one policy decision can have wide-ranging discriminatory effects. The media's picked up on this. And this will make it harder for citizens of these rural counties to vote.    And I'm just as concerned about the discriminatory economic effects of this decision, which will fall hardest on rural, poor, and African-American communities. I imagine a Black farmer driving hundreds of miles across rural Alabama to renew an expired driver's license. And, on this Committee, we know what might happen to such a young man.

I visited with your Chairman and Ranking Member here, the Chairman and Ranking Member of Ag Appropriations to let them know of my plans and to do that. I may not be as attuned to the Federal requirements of permission as they are, but all I know is my heartbeat is to make good and to do well, and to make sure USDA continues to serve the best way. I can't answer the specific process question that you asked.	Yes, we have the legislation, it is just a matter of authorizing the expenditure on that. And I would like to offer an invitation to you to come see the locks and dam system along the Mississippi River. That is the entire western border of my district is the Mississippi, and seeing the locks and dams that were built in the 1930s that really need a lot of attention. But we would love to have you come and visit us, so consider that an invitation.    Quickly shifting gears, yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released a report outlining many of the economic challenges in rural America, which I would like to have entered into the record. But I would also like to acknowledge something that Congresswoman Fudge said earlier, that I am concerned about the Trump Administration budget that calls for a 21 percent cut in USDA, including eliminating Rural Development's water infrastructure programs, and the Rural Business--Cooperative Service. Just a big concern. And that can be echoed, you will probably hear some other questions from my colleagues here. But the reorganization also eliminates the Rural Development mission area entirely, as well as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary, which you have addressed for a moment. But it is my understanding that you have already submitted the reorganization plan to Congress for the mandatory 30 day notification period, however, just today, you sought public comment through a Federal Register notice on the proposal. I was wondering about the formal reorganization plan sent to Congress, why that was presented to Congress before seeking feedback from the impacted stakeholders.

All these tools, we have to have those tools and more available because our producers are going to challenge us. They can grow it, they have demonstrated they can grow it, and the challenge would be to feed that hungry world with trade and export. We need all those tools available.	Okay, great.

It is a real challenge, but most of the challenge comes from the countercyclical culture of growth. I mean they are lower in the hemisphere than we are, and can grow things different seasonally in that way. But we have to make sure that the safety of those products is just what we insist on in our American producers as well.

11525545015	100000	It is a good question. Mission has no change at all. Personnel, no change. All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.    There will be no change in the mission. We are realigning, in a closer family atmosphere where we can have a critical mass to help people better.	It is just the most amazing thing. The potential for that extension would have a tremendous impact upon my constituents.    To touch on one other point that my colleagues have talked about already, in concept, the NRCS, the FSA, and the RMA coordination could improve by being under a single mission area of farm production and conservation. And I am particularly sensitive about these issues because my district was ground zero in the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. And part of why, in the drought of the 1950s, and the drought that we went through in the early part of this decade, things were so dramatically different were all of those conservation efforts properly practiced out there, encouraged by the NRCS and the predecessors of the Soil Conservation Service. How will you ensure that that conservation mission will not be diminished in any way under this new management program, and that the voluntary incentive-based conservation, which is the way we have practiced it since the 1930s, will continue to be the highest priority of the Department?

Any email that existed anywhere, even any hard copy of official records that existed anywhere, has been or will be provided to this committee.	Well, Castillo is now on trial for murdering his wife, but, before that, this committee discovered that he had wrongfully received $500 million in contracts, IT contracts, from the IRS.    And Gregory Roseman took the Fifth. He was one of your employees who helped get him that contract.    When you go home tomorrow or the next day, you might want to see Congresswoman Duckworth asking him how his ankle that he hurt at the prep school feels, because, in fact, he claimed to be a disabled veteran some 27 years later. And his old college buddy, a lifelong friend, helped him get that contract.    At that time and now, we rely on the ability to recover emails as part of the chain of discovery. TIGTA Russell George, your IG, relies on that. Tomorrow we'll hear from the head of the National Archives, the Archivist. He relies on your organization to comply with Federal law.    The question I have for you is, how can we expect--you have servers that run Microsoft Exchange. It captures every email in and out.

11426003023	1000	Ranking Member Waters, I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we have always known, as in any sales organization, you're going to have to be diligent, because not every team member will do everything right every day. So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.	Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states.

11635589125	101000	Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.    As for what is going to be shared and released on conversations between the President and his foreign partners, the White House ultimately makes those decisions. And so, the inquiries would properly be lodged there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us. Thank you for your service.    March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?

11635589064	1100	So, I think it is important to consider all of these things in the context of the challenges from China. You have seen what we have done with respect to Taiwan. It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, as you know, last Congress I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act, and President Trump signed it into law last March. The intention of this legislation was to allow our high-level officials to go to Taipei and to allow their high-level officials to come here to the United States, including Washington. In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations? And can the people of Taiwan count on you to advocate for further implementation of that I think very important legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act?

11420722045	101000	Congressman, I think the issue, as is usual, doesn't really lend itself well to aphorisms and short statements. And it's my hope that the work of many on this Committee and, indeed, throughout Congress in having the discussion that has begun on this issue will continue so that we can, in fact, continue to work on the serious issues of access to firearms in our society.    Earlier this year, I did make several recommendations to the White House, which were accepted, for important ways for dealing with this issue, ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers, ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities, such as trusts.    But also, as part of that, a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the information and the issues arising out of gun violence, as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy.

11420722043	1	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed. And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?	And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?

11420722029	100000	Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair. That, in and of itself, will go a long way toward restoring faith and trust in the overall criminal justice system, which is also a problem often raised to my attention during my travels.    So the Department looks forward to continuing to support those important efforts.	Thank you for your response.    I would like to ask you in a friendly way how we can--as a Committee, what is it that we can do to address the problem?    And we seek your friendly advice in that direction because we want to work together with all the branches of government, and the House Judiciary Committee is in a very unusually important position to play an important role in this.

11635589098	1001	I will have to look into it.	Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.    In particular, we have seen your Assistant Secretary of State Chris Ford say the Department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of understanding, which do not require congressional oversight or approval, rather than through a one-two-three agreement.    And we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which in normal course are made available to the public, but are, instead, being kept secret, all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.    So, can I count on you and the Administration to release these six--they are called Part 810 authorizations--by the middle of this month?

You know that those contracts are set and it can't be changed for this incident, this tragedy that just happened, but the RMA has learned from that, and certainly on some of these dates on practical replant, makes a huge difference for guarding yield production, the quality of seed, the hybrid seed, and other things, the chemicals that are linked with that. You will see, and I will commit to you that you will see some changes in the RMA practical dates, going forward, for the 2018 contract.	It has been just a couple of weeks since we toured some of the devastation in my district. Let me thank you for your responsiveness, your Department's responsiveness, and your personal attention on that issue. I think our 100 year floods are coming a little more frequently than every 100 years. This is our third in 6 years, you saw that yourself. And I guess, as I mentioned before, and has been talked about here, crop insurance is an important component, no question about it, but as it applies to rice the practical to replant provision there has really added more confusion than clarity. And so I am hoping that you can, and I am certain that you will work with us on actually trying to provide some flexibility on that because, as you know, after May 15 it is strictly not practical to replant rice and expect a yield, so having some alternative would be much appreciated?

11420722054	1100	Congressman, with respect to the Director's statements, as I've indicated, he's provided really unprecedented access into his views of the matter, and I would refer you to them.    I understand the issue that you raise, obviously, is one involving perceptions as to whether or not charges would have been brought in some other situation. And, again, I can only refer you back to the Director's statements, where he chose to outline the fact that no other cases similar to this had, in fact, been brought.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Madam Attorney General, I think the thing that I find so disheartening, so unfortunate, about FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week was that, for a lot of Americans, it looked like we're seeing a double standard, unequal treatment under the law.    Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.    Now, I assume that, based upon the way you've answered some of my colleague's questions prior to this, you're not going to acknowledge what I think virtually every other American believes, even her supporters, and that's to at least acknowledge, as Director Comey did, that she lied.

11525545090	100000	Yes, in the broad answer. Specifically, on the 1,200-foot dam, we will look at that and see. I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy. If there is anything we can do, I commit to being a serious advocate for American agriculture. The logistics part is part of that, and the waterways are right at the front of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Perdue, thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with you as I represent the northwestern part of the State of Illinois.    I want to start with a quick question, I hope, and then go into something a little more in-depth. To start with, our aging locks and dam system. There is $37 billion in agriculture and food products that flow through the Illinois ports and waterways. Upgrading aging locks and dams on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers is a top priority for the growers that I represent in my region. Congress has authorized these upgrades, but the Administration has to request the funding. And what I would ask of you, if you can answer with a yes or no that would be appreciated, but can we count on you to push this Administration to invest in our water infrastructure, and specifically, will you push for 1,200-foot locks on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in the President's infrastructure plan?

We have not done any pre-judgment, we have not come to any pre-determined conclusions. We have simply given notice of our intention to do so, which is exactly what the APA implies.

11497630092	101	Thank you, Congresswoman.    With respect to the argument that was made on the issue, of course I'd have to review those pleadings to understand the specific context and whether or not there was an appropriations issue involved as to whether----	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Attorney General. It's a pleasure to have you here, and I look forward to working with you, not only today, but in the months ahead.    As you likely know, I am on the Immigration Subcommittee and I follow closely what your Department is doing in that arena. Your predecessor, Attorney General Holder, testified in 2013 before the Senate, and this is a direct quote: ``It is inexcusable that young kids, 6, 7 year olds, 14 year olds, have immigration decisions made on their behalf against them and they're not represented by counsel.''    Now, in July of this year, the American Immigration Council and several other organizations filed a class action lawsuit in District Court in the Western District of Washington challenging the validity of removal proceedings for children without appointed counsel. And their argument was that an 8-year-old couldn't receive a full and fair hearing in the immigration court without representation.    As you know, I'm sure, the Administration has made efforts to provide counsel to small children by funding nonprofit groups, but the Assistant Attorney General who argued, I think a Mr. Leon Fresco, actually argued contrary to that in the District Court.

11497630000	101000	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    With respect to that important issue, as I've indicated, the most important priority of the Department of Justice is the protection of the American people. And, certainly, national security and terrorism are one of my own top priorities and certainly an area of concern for all of us. That is certainly our main concern.    At the same time, we do have a system for allowing not just immigration but refugee entrance into the country. As the FBI Director has noted, there is a process in place that allows for significant vetting of refugees from all countries.	Thank you, General Lynch.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.    Yesterday, a video reportedly linked to ISIS was posted stating that, ``As we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington.''    Now, there is little doubt that ISIS views the United States and the West as a strategic enemy, and there is little doubt that our immigration laws, our lawful immigration laws, have been abused on a number of occasions by people intending to perpetrate harm against the United States.    Do you agree with what your own FBI Director, James Comey, told this Committee regarding the inability to adequately vet and confirm the true identity because of the lack of information, databases, law enforcement resources, intelligence resources, and military resources available to us in Syria of Syrians who have applied for refugee resettlement in the United States?

11426003139	1011	I don't have a precise count of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.    So my question to you, Mr. Stumpf, first is, how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?

The witness did answer the question. But, he is stating the answer as if he did not have anything to do with sending the hard drive to CO. I am a little skeptical about his motives. For now, it appears he answered and gave a little extra information. Questioner asks simple, reasonable question about why a specific action was taken.

All of the TIGTA report didn't blanket say you should never ask questions about this. Thank you for the chart.	Okay. Well, this is put out by the Exempt Organizations Division, same division where all these problems took place over the last three years. It came out, again, just five days after the comment period on the proposed rule ended at the end of February, and I want to just highlight a few of the questions that are asked. So there is a category that says what if the IRS needs more information about your (c)(4) application? New sample questions. So if we could put them up side-by-side.    Now, the first slide are the targeted questions that TIGTA said were inappropriate and that you agree are inappropriate, Judith Kendall agreed are inappropriate. Those are those questions. And now, just five days after the proposed rule comment period ends, you issue a newsletter from the Exempt Organizations Division highlighting the new questions you are going to ask, and I just want to look how similar the two questions are.    Let's just take the second category, whether an officer or director, etcetera, has run or will run for public office. The new question says this: Do you support a candidate for public office who is one of your founders, officers, or board members? It is basically the same. This reminds me of when I was in grade school and the teachers told us you shouldn't plagiarize, so you change a few words and basically plagiarize. This is the same thing.    So here is what I don't understand. If you are trying to comply with the TIGTA report, if the new (c)(4) rule is a way to deal with what the audit said and not as what I believe is a continuation of the project Lois Lerner started, why are you asking the same darn questions?

11497630027	100000	Mr. Congressman, our discussion about civil rights and the appropriate use of force and all police tactics can only serve to make all of us, the community members and police officers, safer.    In my discussions with police officers around the country, I have found a positive engagement on these issues. I have found them to have some of the best thoughts and best practices to share with other departments on these issues--issues like the best practices for deescalation of certain situations, issues like the best practices for maintaining a relationship with community organizations and citizens councils, issues on police safety. They've provided us valuable input in our program, such as providing bulletproof vests, body-worn cameras. They are focusing on the best ways to use these new technologies.    So, while certainly there may be anecdotal evidence there, as all have noted, there's no data to support it. And what I have seen in my travels across this country is the dedication, the commitment, and the resolve of our brave men and women in law enforcement to improving policing, to embracing the 21st-Century Task Force recommendations, and to continuing to have a dialogue that makes our country safer for all.	Thank you.    In recent weeks, there have been some suggestions, some from within your department, that our dialogue on these issues have somehow reduced the willingness of some police officers to perform their duties.    I know of no real evidence to substantiate this claim, but, in your opinion, does that conversation about civil rights and the appropriate use of force by police somehow make us less safe?

We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.	Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.

11525545120	101100	One of the things that has not been talked about in our realignment, reorganization had to do with aligning NRCS and their mission area with FSA. That leaves NRE really with the responsibility of managing our U.S. Forest Service. That is where over 1/3 of the employees in USDA are, and that is, frankly, where some of the biggest challenges have come from. We face litigation, we face NEPA challenges, and other kinds of things in order to utilize the renewable resources on all of our millions of acres out here; northern California and many other states, to do that. Actually, that means jobs as well.    The good news, the fact is a healthy forest is less vulnerable to fire, and you all know that the fire budget has kind of gotten upside down in the Forest Service. We are spending more to fight fires than we are to prevent fires. We hope to get that corrected with your help and reestablished. But I believe, again, a mission area that is focused directly on utilizing the renewable aspects; whether it is deadfall going into biomass, or recovering these trees that might be down, they have a certain period of time that you can harvest them and they would be good lumber, to get ahead of that curve. The challenge is right now so much of that budget is spent in suppression rather than prevention, and we have to get ahead of that. But that is my desire.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Mr. Secretary. It is really great to have you here, and I hope things are going well for you in your transition. And it is also very heartening to hear the colleagues that you know the best; our Georgia colleagues, that have welcomed you here today, and the nonpartisan way which everybody likes working with you. That is a really good indicator compared to some of the things going on around this town.    There are so many issues here, and I am hoping, of course, that we see a rebound in ag commodities at the farm gate there, and then we can see exports are expected to come back up a little bit from a peak of just a few years ago.    We have a lot of issues going on. I have a northern California district, top of the state, and one of the things that we are very, very, concerned about is USDA's oversight of the Forest Service and the need to be much better managing our Federal lands, and moving more into biomass using this over-inventory we have of forest products, so that really need to be managed much better, as we have wildfires every year and we need to incentivize the biomass situation.    So as we work on the Federal land issue, what do you think we can do to grow the markets for biomass, have more economic activity that would be jobs right in our own backyard, for material that needs to be moved right out of our backyard, for private land and Federal land?

11525545128	101000	Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well. All of that is complicated, complex, but it needs to be all of our business about that.	California is number one in medium grade. Thank you for meeting the California folks earlier this week as well too; for rice. We just need a little more help in the exports on that, getting more of that product into Japan. There was a lot of disappointment over the TPP with only opening up another 50,000 tons, which I and about seven other growers could grow that ourselves. That didn't mean a whole lot, so maybe as that comes back around, we can see a little more entry for rice as well as other exports.    Last, I would just like to hear what you think on this. We did hear a little mention of SNAP earlier. We have had a lot of hearings on that during this last year. Very comprehensive. And it keeps coming up the issue of SNAP, which is a program this Committee very strongly supports, but the way it is targeted, and there are a lot of issues with some of the products SNAP is being used for; soda and candy, and things like that, that aren't generally healthy, where the original intent was ag products that come from here.

11635589003	1000	I do not want to speak about particular troop levels. I will leave that to the Department of Defense. But I can talk about the policy. The President has made clear he wants to put as few American soldiers' lives at risk as he possibly can and do so while achieving America's important policy interests. I think we can do that.    By the way, I have a senior State Department official who is working diligently to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 and to work with the Turks and with the Kurds to create conditions on the ground, in the real estate that separates Syria and Turkey, so that we can continue to maintain the vigilance that led to the destruction of the caliphate.    It is a longer answer, but this fits inside our policy throughout the Middle East, whether it is Iraq or in Syria, the work that we are doing to help Lebanon, the work we are doing with our Gulf partners to achieve precisely what it is I think you describe, a secure situation for the American people and an increase in the stability throughout the Middle East.	I just want you to know that I have here the OIG's email confirming that they have no problems with the Department providing these documents to Congress. It has just been very frustrating, and I am sure you can understand, the stonewalling we have been getting for over a year now. And it is very frustrating. All we want to know is what we are entitled to know. A call from your staff just days before this hearing in which they did not agree to produce any documents is really not a good-faith effort. So, I would hope, based on what you have said, that you will provide us the documents the committee requested, and I hope you can do that within 1 week. There is nothing outlandish or outrageous. We are just trying to do our jobs.    I want to ask you a question about Syria. I am very worried about President Trump's statement that we are going to pull out of Syria. I do not want the United States to be in a foreign country any more than we have to, but pulling out of Syria would be a betrayal to the Kurds, our faithful allies for many, many years; saved American lives. It would create problems for our ally Israel because it would put the Iranian regime right on Israel's border. And if and when we ever had to come back, it would probably result in more American casualties. Right now, we seem to have the situation pretty much in hand.    So, I hope that the President's precipitous statement that we were going to, after he allegedly spoke with Mr. Erdogan of Turkey, that we were going to pull out of Syria soon, immediately, or whatever, is not the truth, is not so, and that we have rethought it. And can you give us some assurances on that?	And can you give us some assurances on that?

The 3-day waiting period is part of congressional action that has already been voted on by Congress.

We are working to improve the NICS system to make it as efficient as possible. We've expanded the number of personnel working on those background checks. We are working also to improve the automated portion of the NICS system so that the dealers who go through the system will be able to get information more quickly and to be able to respond, either by proceeding or denying a sale or in other ways as appropriate.    So we are working within the system as it is currently structured. In order to change that, it would require congressional action.

I think that we have recognized certain rights for those within our borders, certain rights for citizens in varying degrees with respect to the Constitution. But barring that or even taking it into consideration, certainly I believe that all of our detention centers should be run efficiently, fairly, and humanely.	Finally, I want to mention a situation. We've had a class action complaint that's now moot because the individuals who filed the complaint have been released from detention. They're mothers who were being held in prison with their children in Karnes. And they had a demonstration and in response they were put in solitary confinement with their children.

11525545051	100100	Well, as a veterinarian, I obviously understand the benefit of vaccination, and the fact that we cannot psychologically afford even a foot-and-mouth disease scare here at all. We saw what BSE did to us, and we talked about that earlier, but I want to compliment you on how well you listened in Iowa. I was delighted to be in your district, and to move up from the cows on the farm, a very innovative family farm operation there, up to the APHIS Ames facility. I was very impressed. We talked specifically about vaccine banks there. They are a repository, along with Iowa State, a USDA facility responsible for vaccination protocols as well. I am hopeful, I look at vaccine banks as insurance, and you can't have your house burn down and take out insurance after the fact and have it pay off. You have to have vaccines and you have to have a vaccine availability ahead of the time. I look at it as a wise insurance program.	I want to start out with a retraction of a statement that I made when I first heard of your name coming forward as Secretary of Agriculture, and I will say I thought it was candidly, but I said I hope it is more than about peaches and peanuts. And you came to Iowa 11 days after confirmation, and it was absolutely clear it is much, much more than about peaches and peanuts. And I was gratified to hear many of the things that you had to say there in the heart of my district. And I just wrote down a few of them here from memory. There will be a lot of colloquialisms that will come from our new Secretary of Agriculture, and it adds a lot of flavor to our rural life. For example, I am speaking of the trade that you grow it, we will sell it. I like that bumper sticker, and I have every confidence that will be the policy coming out of the USDA.    And now, one of the other things you said is an oath is stronger even than a contract. That stuck in my mind as the piece of wisdom that a lot of us can apply to our job here every single day. And let's see, the equipment might be a little different but the people are the same. That is another thing that is true all across this country, and it is something we can keep in mind here in this Agriculture Committee. And I will leave out the full story about the cow's tail, but that made it all real, Mr. Secretary.    So I wanted to welcome you to this Agriculture Committee, and I look forward to many discussions that we will have in the future years, and they will be very productive.    One of the things on my mind though as far as an issue is concerned is the fear of foot-and-mouth disease, and it is some of the things that we have been working on for I would say a year and a half or 2 years now in my district and beyond. That is the worst calamity we can imagine as far as biosecurity situation is concerned. I have been doing some work there through Iowa State, and the request that I see across the industry is for a vaccine bank that starts out at about $150 million, and then sells off some of that vaccine and keeps always a fresh supply there. We have another way to go where we can genetically design a vaccine that is going to be cheaper and can be reproduced more quickly.    You went up the road to APHIS and I wasn't able to tag along on that stop, but I wondered if you had any fresh thoughts on FMD and what you might be able to tell this Committee on how you would approach our preparations for potential calamity?

Of course, we will always be deeply indebted to those first responders and brave men and women who risked their lives to search for and recover victims, to remove debris at the site, to carry out the recovery efforts at Ground Zero at 9/11.    It certainly is an important issue to me both as Attorney General and as someone who was in New York on 9/11 and who had friends and former colleagues who were in that group of those who were on the scene and who were involved in those activities. This is, in fact, a serious issue for those who were affected by it, and I greatly appreciate your expression of compassion for those who have fallen ill.    With respect to the bill that is currently pending, certainly, on behalf of the Department of Justice, we would do all that we could to work with you to make sure if there were any questions or issues they could be addressed. And we hope that there would be none.    This is, indeed, an important issue. And, again, I think it is something that deserves, certainly, strong review, serious consideration. And please let us know how the Department can be of assistance to any of the Members as they consider this important issue.	I thank the Chairman.    And I thank the Attorney General.    Madam Attorney General, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice established and oversaw a victims' compensation fund that provided more than $7 billion to families who lost loved ones on that day.    In the years after the attacks, it became clear that thousands of first responders and survivors continued to suffer major health consequences from the attacks and their aftermath. Thousands of lawsuits were filed against contractors and others by these victims.    In 2010, Congress enacted the James Zadroga Act, which provided essential healthcare services to those in need and reopened the Victim Compensation Fund to those families whose losses became apparent after September 11, providing them an alternative to litigation. In the last 5 years, the Victim Compensation Fund has provided nearly 6,300 first responders and survivors with $1.4 billion in compensation determinations. Since we enacted the bill, I am aware of no further 9/11-related lawsuits.    Despite its current success, on September 30, 2015, Congress allowed the VCF and the World Trade Center Health Program to expire. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in the House to permanently reauthorize the Victim Compensation Fund and the World Trade Center Health Program. The bill now has the cosponsorship of 247 cosponsors, a majority of the House, including more than 50 Republicans, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 65 cosponsors.    If Congress fails to act, thousands of first responders and survivors will lose access to compensation on which they depend to support their families when they are tragically gone. The VCF is preparing to shutter its operations once it has processed existing claims. If the VCF is not fully funded and reauthorized, the first responders and survivors who have already received the notice of their compensation could actually see that amount cut by up to 50 percent.    We are literally talking about taking money out of the hands of a sick police officer. I am deeply saddened to think that is how Congress plans to remember the heroes of 9/11.    Attorney General Lynch, do you agree that this is not the proper way to honor the heroes of 9/11? Don't you think that 9/11 survivors and the firefighters and police officers who risked their own lives to save them and have suffered health consequences because of it deserve the full support of the American people and a fully funded Victim Compensation Fund?
