11386195047	100000	I have been informed that it is roughly 90 percent.	Thank you.    And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy. Because an important part of homeland security is economic security, and our economic security is falling. The stock market is closing at the lowest level in a month. The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.    I do want to make an important point, that 195 Democrats have signed a petition saying that they will vote today, they will vote in 10 minutes, to open up the government. And I feel if a vote was allowed on the floor, there would be enough like-minded Republicans that would vote, as we did on the Violence Against Women Act and other areas, jointly in a bipartisan way to open up our government.    And I would say that, instead of having a hearing on unfounded allegations, we should be looking at what the impact of this shutdown is on the IRS and other government agencies and their ability to provide services to the American people.

The witness also goes on to give the courts that have felt more in his favor. This appears to give him more credibility in his opinion of the matter. Sessions states that the policy in question did not appear to him as lawful or proper, and that the Department of Homeland Security ended up withdrawing the policy. Attorney General Sessions answers the question opposing DACA including how he feels about it. Witness answers the question about his position about DACA. He provides details to be helpful. Questioner begins by praising the witness, then segues into allowing him to reiterate his opinion on a particular policy.

11532380055	100000	I did chair that meeting.	Thank you.    Now, I want to show you an image from March 31, 2016, of a meeting of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee, which you chaired, with yourself in attendance, along with then-candidate Donald Trump and Mr. George Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos pled guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI.    The charging papers filed by Special Counsel Mueller describe the March 31 meeting, where Mr. Papadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could help arrange a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to communicate with the Russian Government on behalf of the Trump campaign and appears to have told several senior campaign officials about it.    Now, here is the problem. On October 18 of this year, you said under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, quote, ``A continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian Government did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.''    Senator Franken asked, ``You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?'', to which you responded, ``I did not, and I'm not aware of anyone else that did,'' unquote.    Now, we now know that, one, the campaign had communications with the Russians through Mr. Papadopoulos and others, and, two, you seem to have been aware of the fact at the time.

11531349017	100000	Thank you, Ranking Member Waters. I have been involved. This is the seventh process to select a reserve bank president that I have been involved in since I joined the Fed in 2012, so I am very familiar with the way the process works.    We always insist that the search committee, which consists of the B and C directors of the Reserve Bank, hire a national search firm. We always insist--and they don't need to be pushed into this, this is something they want to do--we always insist that there is a highly diverse candidate pool and that diverse candidates are given serious consideration and every chance to become the successful participant in that process.    I can absolutely guarantee you that that will continue to be the case. We will always have diverse candidates. They will always have a fair shot.    I cannot in any individual case guarantee that there will be a diverse outcome, but I can guarantee that the process will be working in that direction.	Thank you very much.    Chairman Powell, with a permanent voting seat on the FOMC, and its role in supervising some of the largest and most complex financial institutions in the country, the president of the New York Federal Reserve has one of the most important economic policymaking roles in the Nation.    Bill Dudley will step down this year. The search for his replacement is under way. Historically, the New York Fed's close proximity to Wall Street has led to the selection of an individual with close ties to the financial sector.    In your view, how important is it that the individual chosen is a diverse candidate, with demonstrated independence from Wall Street and a strong commitment to the Fed's maximum employment mandate and regulatory responsibilities?    What steps is the board taking to ensure that candidates from diverse gender, racial, and ethnic backgrounds are given due consideration? If diverse candidates are not afforded due consideration, are you prepared to exercise your power as Chair to reject such candidates to serve as the next president of the New York Fed?    I know you have a lot on your plate, but I have to put this question to you because we have to do better about diversity, in particular at the highest levels. Not only am I looking at what is happening with the New York Fed and the possibility there, but we have to look at our own Fed, and think about how diverse is it at the top levels, management levels.

For example, the New York Fed has done extensive outreach to community groups and of that nature, universities and all sorts of things around the New York region and around the Nation.    In addition, the national search firms have a very large presence in the candidate population and know who is out there, know who would be a good candidate. They are always trying to find new candidates, and we are too.    It is something we work very hard at and are always interested in having new ideas for qualified candidates as well. We invite the general public generally to offer their thoughts, as well as some of the interest groups.	I appreciate that. I am sure that you are committed to that. But the diverse candidate question is a question that many of us have, and we don't know that there has been consideration for diverse candidates with these very, very important positions.

11525545199	100000	Yes. It is interesting, I gave those guys the same example of that. While we have the wonderful land-grant institutions that Congressman Scott talked about, we have also got some technology schools that are using great processing technology, harvest technology, and preserving technology that make a lot of sense. We are going to look at where our research dollars go. If it makes sense to have a processing, harvesting part of the whole supply chain to benefit agriculture, we will do that. Our example in Georgia, as Congressman Scott knows, is that while our primary land-grants; University of Georgia as well as Fort Valley State, Georgia Tech Engineering School does a lot of work with poultry processing, and how to make that more efficient and better.    Those are the types of things we want to look at to make sure that we use those research dollars wisely, not just maybe in the basic production or applied production sides, but how we get that product in a safe, palatable way to the consumer.

There are two thoughts there: One, the rise and the intensity and severity of cybersecurity incidents around the country and the world is running at a pace that has never been seen before. And I am convinced there is more we can do in public-private partnership to get ahead of the curve on cybersecurity, not just reacting to it.    Number two is, the more I reflect, think, and talk to experts in the area of cybersecurity, I am convinced there is an opportunity for this partnership between public and private to rethink the concept of a Social Security number, name, date of birth as being the most secure way to identify consumers in the U.S.    It is an instrument that was introduced, as you well know far better than I, back in the 1930s.

11525545029	100000	I would be happy to, Congressman. Again, what we see, I agree with you, I think an insurance program for our producers is a much more palatable safety net program from the public shareholder perspective than direct payments were. I thought you all made a lot of progress in 2014 in transitioning to that area of ARC, PLC, backed up with crop insurance, which put some responsibility on the producers themselves.    Now, that insurance program is not perfect, we have some things we need to readjust. There is, on cotton, for instance, the Chairman is interested in, we have a quality issue that the quality degradation is not right. We hope to adjust that.    The other thing that your producers may have, if they are on ARC, may have a county payment in one county, or might farm in both counties, and it is different and they don't quite understand those differences either as well. There is some fine tuning. Overall, the insurance program has been a great addition. We need to look at more specialty crops, how we can cover more specialty crops in that area and more. We don't want to create a program where our producers are farming for the program, and that happened in the past, and that creates some unnatural market forces that we don't want to have happen. We want a true safety net for those who are doing right, and we don't want people farming for insurance payments either, we want them farming legitimately. But the insurance ought to be utilized when there is a true revenue loss to that producer, be it be price, or be it be production, and how can we design that program.    You all had a great start, and we will look forward to working with you all as we go through the 2014 Farm Bill to make sure that the RMA program is even more effective, going forward. We know that the STAX program was not as helpful to the cotton producers as you all would have hoped, and the dairy program, certainly on some of those issues----	Yes, I hope so too. You might not remember, but about 3 years ago I was asked to make some remarks, it was the National Council of Farmer Co-ops in Hilton Head, and I remember this, after I had made my remarks you came up and introduced yourself and we had a nice little chat. And that is my only interaction so far I have had with you, and it was a good memory so I appreciate that.    I want to mention a couple of things: I want to also thank you for re-evaluating the School Lunch Program, bring some commonsense to that, and I wish somebody, and maybe it will be you, not only talk about the nutrition aspects but let's talk about exercise and activity. School-age kids can burn a lot of calories, and I don't think they are getting the activity and exercise like we used to when we were kids. It is good that we are putting, I guess we only have two percent milk, it is one percent or skim milk in the schools, and just some common sense and reasonableness. And I know my dairy producers will appreciate that in Ohio, we are a big dairy state.    Also I want to thank you too, on the regulatory side the Waters of the United States, some common sense in there, and working with Administrator Pruitt and the EPA to go back to the states, and work on a rule that addresses the Supreme Court decisions.    Also I want to ask a question, first of all, on the crop insurance. Do you have any thoughts how we can make crop insurance better and make it a more essential part of the safety net program, because as a policymaker, when I talk to non-farming public, you talk crop insurance the non-farming public can understand that better. And I would argue in a 10 year budget window, it probably isn't that much cost to the taxpayers, but it really helps in the years when we have a disaster, like a widespread drought. But on the revenue side and the weather side, can you maybe give us your thoughts of what we could do to make crop insurance even better, and it would work for the producers' aspect?

11525545090	100000	Yes, in the broad answer. Specifically, on the 1,200-foot dam, we will look at that and see. I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy. If there is anything we can do, I commit to being a serious advocate for American agriculture. The logistics part is part of that, and the waterways are right at the front of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Perdue, thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with you as I represent the northwestern part of the State of Illinois.    I want to start with a quick question, I hope, and then go into something a little more in-depth. To start with, our aging locks and dam system. There is $37 billion in agriculture and food products that flow through the Illinois ports and waterways. Upgrading aging locks and dams on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers is a top priority for the growers that I represent in my region. Congress has authorized these upgrades, but the Administration has to request the funding. And what I would ask of you, if you can answer with a yes or no that would be appreciated, but can we count on you to push this Administration to invest in our water infrastructure, and specifically, will you push for 1,200-foot locks on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in the President's infrastructure plan?

You know that those contracts are set and it can't be changed for this incident, this tragedy that just happened, but the RMA has learned from that, and certainly on some of these dates on practical replant, makes a huge difference for guarding yield production, the quality of seed, the hybrid seed, and other things, the chemicals that are linked with that. You will see, and I will commit to you that you will see some changes in the RMA practical dates, going forward, for the 2018 contract.

11420722029	100000	Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.

11420722043	1	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed. And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?	And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?

11426003023	1000	Ranking Member Waters, I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we have always known, as in any sales organization, you're going to have to be diligent, because not every team member will do everything right every day. So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines. And I knew and I still know that you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen.    It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the company, which happens to be in the wonderful part of California in which you live.    So these are things we've been working on. All of our strategies around training team members, who get 2 weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch, is about doing things right, about ethics.    And I'd also just want to remind the committee that the vast majority of our people who had the same opportunities, the same training, and the same goals, did it right every day for our customers. In fact, our customer loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.	Thank you very much.    Mr. Stumpf, you have said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013, and it appears that there were activities going on that indicate you may have known much earlier than that.    For example, in 2007, just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community banking division was updated with your executive guidance, as the manual states. That sales guide reminded employees of what should have been obvious, that they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?    That manual also said that sales practices that showed ``questionable activity'' would be sent via high priority to bank executives. So it appears that you knew something in 2007, that unauthorized accounts were a big enough problem that you had to correct your employee manual.    And, as early as 2008, I have documents from court filings showing your employees were contacting your ethics hotline reporting bank fraud and complaining to managers over unauthorized accounts. And so it looks as if you certainly knew in 2008.    What's more, I have here a consent order with the Fed from 2011 that puts your company on watch for sales quotas and compensation schemes that pushed employees to break the law.

11531349103	1000	First, again, I am not at all familiar with either the British bill or the EEOC proposed rule that was--I am not familiar with either of those. These are the things that Congress should consider. We have a job, we have a really important job to do that you have assigned us to do. For now we are going to stick to that and try to achieve--	OK, fair enough. The reason you are not familiar with it is because the Trump Administration stopped it. It was proposed in 2016. Companies were given 2 years to work their way in. But as of last August, the Trump Administration said no, we don't want to know how you pay women, how you pay people of racial groups or ethnicity groups. We don't care about that.    Now, I personally think that is horrendous and I would actually say that, again, if you are interested in an economy that has some degree of equitability you need statistics. You need numbers. Anecdotal answers are very interesting and they make for good political commentary, but they don't help us address the problems.    I would ask therefore if something like that, that is new to Britain, doesn't seem to have impacted Barclays in any particularly bad way, but provides us the information we have to go forward to argue for pay equity across the board.    Now, I am a white male, but I am not interested in my success being at the expense of people who are not white men.

11525545015	100000	It is a good question. Mission has no change at all. Personnel, no change. All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.    There will be no change in the mission. We are realigning, in a closer family atmosphere where we can have a critical mass to help people better.	It is just the most amazing thing. The potential for that extension would have a tremendous impact upon my constituents.    To touch on one other point that my colleagues have talked about already, in concept, the NRCS, the FSA, and the RMA coordination could improve by being under a single mission area of farm production and conservation. And I am particularly sensitive about these issues because my district was ground zero in the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. And part of why, in the drought of the 1950s, and the drought that we went through in the early part of this decade, things were so dramatically different were all of those conservation efforts properly practiced out there, encouraged by the NRCS and the predecessors of the Soil Conservation Service. How will you ensure that that conservation mission will not be diminished in any way under this new management program, and that the voluntary incentive-based conservation, which is the way we have practiced it since the 1930s, will continue to be the highest priority of the Department?

11635589003	1000	I do not want to speak about particular troop levels. I will leave that to the Department of Defense. But I can talk about the policy. The President has made clear he wants to put as few American soldiers' lives at risk as he possibly can and do so while achieving America's important policy interests. I think we can do that.    By the way, I have a senior State Department official who is working diligently to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 and to work with the Turks and with the Kurds to create conditions on the ground, in the real estate that separates Syria and Turkey, so that we can continue to maintain the vigilance that led to the destruction of the caliphate.    It is a longer answer, but this fits inside our policy throughout the Middle East, whether it is Iraq or in Syria, the work that we are doing to help Lebanon, the work we are doing with our Gulf partners to achieve precisely what it is I think you describe, a secure situation for the American people and an increase in the stability throughout the Middle East.	I just want you to know that I have here the OIG's email confirming that they have no problems with the Department providing these documents to Congress. It has just been very frustrating, and I am sure you can understand, the stonewalling we have been getting for over a year now. And it is very frustrating. All we want to know is what we are entitled to know. A call from your staff just days before this hearing in which they did not agree to produce any documents is really not a good-faith effort. So, I would hope, based on what you have said, that you will provide us the documents the committee requested, and I hope you can do that within 1 week. There is nothing outlandish or outrageous. We are just trying to do our jobs.    I want to ask you a question about Syria. I am very worried about President Trump's statement that we are going to pull out of Syria. I do not want the United States to be in a foreign country any more than we have to, but pulling out of Syria would be a betrayal to the Kurds, our faithful allies for many, many years; saved American lives. It would create problems for our ally Israel because it would put the Iranian regime right on Israel's border. And if and when we ever had to come back, it would probably result in more American casualties. Right now, we seem to have the situation pretty much in hand.    So, I hope that the President's precipitous statement that we were going to, after he allegedly spoke with Mr. Erdogan of Turkey, that we were going to pull out of Syria soon, immediately, or whatever, is not the truth, is not so, and that we have rethought it. And can you give us some assurances on that?	And can you give us some assurances on that?

And I would urge you to have hearings where we hear from the CEOs of Bank of America, Citigroup, and others.    And, until then, I hope that you would join with me in a letter of inquiry to ask what new account-opening quotas they had for their bank tellers, how many people they fired for not meeting their quotas, or how many people they fired for opening phony accounts.    We have Wells Fargo before me, but I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience. Your colleagues should at least come forward with some assurance.

11497630027	100000	Mr. Congressman, our discussion about civil rights and the appropriate use of force and all police tactics can only serve to make all of us, the community members and police officers, safer.    In my discussions with police officers around the country, I have found a positive engagement on these issues. I have found them to have some of the best thoughts and best practices to share with other departments on these issues--issues like the best practices for deescalation of certain situations, issues like the best practices for maintaining a relationship with community organizations and citizens councils, issues on police safety.

11389598067	100000	That's correct. All the emails before June----	Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I have known the Commissioner for many years, and I know him to be a good public servant. I'm a little bit baffled.    I know, John, I think that you're probably in a position of the guy at the end of the parade with the broom and shovel here and in a very difficult situation.    Let me, if I can, just take people back to the history of this, and to you, Commissioner. This targeting began sometime in March or April of 2010. In June of 2010, Chairman Issa alerted IRS and it made an inquiry. In February of 2011, Lois Lerner sent an email to IRS employees stating that the Tea Party is a very dangerous matter.    Then the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction, in June of 2011, June 3rd, Dave Camp, who you spent time with recently, sent a letter to IRS the heat--it looks like the heat really started to come on at that point.    Now, an entire administration and one of the biggest scandals in government was back during Watergate when, what, 18 minutes of tape was lost. And somehow, between June 3rd and June 13th, Lois Lerner's hard drive crashes and is gone in 10 days.

I would suggest to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, he must not be saying when he's saying that he's seeking one honest that everyone on this side of the aisle is somehow dishonest. I know that can't be the case, particularly when some of us have broken ranks, for example, offering and asking for a subpoena with respect to child separation policies.    But to suggest that we're somehow dishonest by saying you're seeking to find one honest man because we believe that this is a charade and a waste of the time of the American people, I think that that is a questionable direction to go.    And with respect to the Obama years, I would just raise that it would be awfully nice if my colleagues on the other side would recognize the President sent up a request for $762.8 million for ICE when the problem that we had on our border was nothing like it is today.

But that's irrelevant, of course, because you're a professional committed to the rule of law and you're governed by the Hatch Act itself.    I want to ask you about the Hatch Act, because I've got 65,000 constituents who are Federal employees. They've been told they cannot wear a button to work that says resist. They cannot talk about impeachment on the job. And the way I understand it is they can do whatever they want on their own private time in terms of electoral activity, but when they come to work they're there to work. They're not there to campaign for or against anybody.    Is that a basic intuitive understanding of the statute?	Is that a basic intuitive understanding of the statute?

Congressman, I believe that what needs to be clear is that what actions we took this week were to ensure that data and methodology were also available to those that are are concerned about our rulemaking.	Sir, I need to move on. I take that as a yes. To mitigate that concern it appears that the proposal has been crafted so that you, the Administrator, has the discretion to grant exemptions as you see fit without any transparency or accountability for your decisions. For example, if EPA was assessing the safety of a chemical, you alone would have the power to selectively block public health studies that do not support your political priorities and allow ones that favor your friends in industry. Not only does this open the door to special treatment for industry over the public health, but you could also pick winners and losers amongst the industry types.

11422125144	100	I can't at this point. What I can say in response to the first part of your question, any hacking is something we take very seriously. Any hacking in connection with this Nation's election system is something we take extraordinarily seriously, the whole of government. So it is something the FBI is spending a lot of time on right now to try and understand. So what are they up to and what does it involve and what is the scope of it to equip the President to decide upon the appropriate response. And so that is one of reasons I have to be very careful about what I say about it. That work is ongoing. I should make clear to folks when we talk about our election system, there has been a lot of press reporting about attempts to intrude into voter registration databases. Those are connected to the Internet. That is very different than the electoral mechanism in this country, which is not.	All right. I am hoping that we can get some insight in an appropriate classified setting on that.    Now, we have watched with some concern--and I know you are also concerned--about the Russian intrusion into our election system. It has been reported to us that the Russians hacked into the Democratic National Committee database. They also hacked into the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And it seems that they are making an effort to influence the outcome of this election. We have been warned that the information stolen might not just be released but also be altered and forged and then released, in an effort to impact the election here in the United States.    Yesterday, there were press reports--and I don't know if they are accurate, and I am interested if you are able to tell us--that the Russians have also hacked the telephones of Democratic staffers and that there was a request for Democratic staffers to bring their cell phones into the FBI to have them mirrored.

11495063080	100000	Thank you. For one, we apply the exact same exacting credit standards for large transactions and small, for renewable transactions or other transactions.    Renewable transactions--according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), globally the United States and other export credit agencies can extend loans as long as 18 years.    And in fact, Jim Rogers, former chairman of Duke Energy, said just recently that we need export credit agencies essentially to finance power projects, conventional and renewable, because banks will only lend for 5 to 7 years. So we provide a longer term to make sure this capital equipment can be paid off.	Again, please accept my sincerest apologies for the slander.    [laughter]    I want to talk about renewables a little bit. Since 2002, Congress has directed the Ex-Im Bank to promote the export of goods and services related to renewable energy sources. Although it is not explicitly part of the Bank's charter, since 2008 appropriators have included language directing the Bank to make available not less than 10 percent of its aggregate authority to finance renewable energy exports.    Now, Chairman Hochberg, can you please describe how the the Bank finances renewable energy and environmentally-beneficial exports?

Now, Commissioner Koskinen, last week, many Members of Congress, including our own chairman, suggested that Lois Lerner intentionally crashed her computer to destroy emails. But, last Friday, you testified about the facts. You provided Congress with evidence from 2011, contemporaneous, by the way, emails showing exactly the opposite and that this was a technological problem. Since some Members of Congress are still pushing this accusation, I want to walk through these emails.    And let me ask staff to put up the slides.    On July 19th, 2011, Lois Lerner emailed Associate Chief Information Officer at the IRS for help in recovering her hard drive. And it says, ``I'm taking advantage of your offer to try and recapture my lost personal files. My computer skills are pretty basic, so nothing fancy. But there were some documents in the files that are irreplaceable. Whatever you can do to help is greatly appreciated.''    Commissioner Koskinen, is that right? Is that accurate?	Is that accurate?

11525545112	100000	Well, when it comes to food safety, Congressman, there is a zero tolerance policy, and that is what Americans expect, that is what we have come to benefit from, and the veterinary profession is intimately involved in that. When I graduated from veterinary school in 1971, I had volunteered for an assignment in the United States Air Force. I don't know that I realized that that would be a food safety and public health mission there. When I served in Ohio it was food safety and public health, and I learned a broad perspective of how important that was. The food safety industry and profession had not matured at that time in the 1970s, but I learned a lot about it, was trained in that area.    We have great veterinarians in our inspection services all over. And while you are correct, your veterinary school in Pennsylvania is one of the renowned ones, along with Iowa State, Kansas, and others, along with my alma mater, University of Georgia, have done a great job putting out professionals who are part of that food safety network. We have also got great career professionals in USDA under the guidance of veterinarians who are doing great work in that.    Much of the foodborne illness you see happens after that in the supply chain, delivery, in restaurants, and others, but we are committed to a zero tolerance policy to make sure that the food that Americans feed their families are safe.

11530956102	100000	Yes, Congressman. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify that.    So one of the questions is, what information do we track and why about people who are not signed into Facebook? We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. For security, it is to make sure that people who are not signed into Facebook can't scrape people's public information.    You can--even when you are not signed in, you can look up the information that people have chosen to make public on their page because they wanted to share it with everyone, so there is no reason why you should have to be logged in.    But, nonetheless, we don't want someone to be able to go through and download every single public piece of information. Even if someone chose to make it public, that doesn't mean that it is good to allow someone to aggregate it. So, even if someone isn't logged in, we track certain information, like how many pages they are accessing, as a security measure.    The second thing that we do is we provide an ad network that third-party websites and apps can run in order to help them make money. And those ads, similar to what Google does and what the rest of the industry does, it is not limited to people who are just on Facebook. So, for the purposes of that, we may also collect information to make it so that those ads are more relevant and work better on those websites.    There is a control that for that second class of information or an ad targeting anyone can turn off, has complete control over it. For obvious reasons, we do not allow people to turn off the measurement that we do around security.	Clarify and have more confidence.    The last question I have is, in yesterday's hearing, you talked a little about Facebook tracking and different scenarios, including logged-off users.

11426003105	100000	At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.    In the time remaining, let's get to the securities questions. The Securities Exchange Act requires a public company to keep its disclosure in place--that's under SOX--requires the CEO and the CFO to attest to financial statements.

If it makes you feel better to call that person ``Under Secretary'' then enjoy that, but that person is going to have not only the responsibility of managing that portfolio, doing what we were doing that way, but also having direct access so we can move quickly and nimbly with a vision of improving rural America. So that is important. That person will be Senate-confirmed in that area, so you will have an opportunity to visit with that person and ask them all those questions of their commitment and passion to Rural Development.

11530242056	100000	Congressman, I can reassure you that we took a lot of time to think about the notification process. I will make one point of clarification. On the 24th, the knowledge we had surrounding the breach was still fluid. It was fluid through the 7th. In fact, it was fluid--the forensics did not conclude until Monday of this week.    The other thing I will say is that Mandiant, the cybersecurity forensic experts, recommended that we really prepare ourselves for significant increase, cyber attacks, when you went live with an announcement.    So between the 24th and the 7th, a lot of energy was spent securing wherever we could secure our facilities to give us the best protection against cyber attacks. And also, as you mentioned, Congressman, we had to standup the environment call centers, train people, staff people, pull together the product, the service offering, so a lot of work was being done over those 2 weeks.	The Chairman did a good job of discussing the notification problems with regards to this situation. Can you tell me, what do you believe is a better way to notify the individuals? A minute ago you said you basically knew on the 24th that individual data had been breached, and it wasn't until the 7th, which is 2 weeks later, that you really made a notification to the individuals.    Even if you can't get your systems up and running so you can take phone calls, don't you think it would be better to have at least notified the individuals, if not by just a public declaration saying, hey, we have been breached, millions of people's information could have been breached; therefore, all of you who are in our systems need to take precautions and let them on their own take whatever precautions they can rather than wait to find out if they had been hacked or if their information has been breached?

11636001109	100000	Congressman, I appreciate that question, and I know how Ohio has been dramatically affected by the opioid crisis. We have done a lot at the Department of Justice, and I would like to partner with this committee and I am sure General Barr would as well to combat and have additional tools to combat this opioid crisis. But some of the things that we have done is we set up in 2017 the Opioid Fraud and Detection Unit, which was a way that the Justice Department could utilize data to help combat the devastating opioid crisis. We did the largest healthcare fraud takedown in June of 2018. We set up the PIL Task Force, otherwise known as the Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force, in February of 2018. We set up a really innovative way called Operation SOS, which was Synthetic Opioid Surge. General Sessions and I went down to Tampa, Florida, where we saw Manatee County had taken an AUSA and embedded them once a week into the sheriff's office in order to take every fentanyl overdose case, and they dramatically reduced the number of overdose deaths in Manatee County. And we decided to take that model and apply it to the most affected States and districts that could really make a dramatic difference in saving lives.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Acting Attorney General, as you mentioned earlier, there are other important matters within the purview of the Justice Department and within the oversight responsibilities of this committee besides fishing expeditions, trying to get the goods on this President in an apparent effort to impeach him. For example, 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. I am old enough to remember back in the mid '80s when President Ronald Reagan and his wife felt so compelled to do something about the scourge of drugs in this country that the effort to just say no began and other efforts following that, and that was because back at that time, we had 10,000 deaths a year due to drug overdoses, and we now have over 70,000 deaths. So it is gotten, unfortunately, over time worse, not better. And most of the increase in deaths in 2017 were due to synthetic drugs, synthetic opioids specifically, like fentanyl, which accounted for a significant number of those deaths. This is clearly an epidemic which has been declared a state of emergency nationwide by the President and has deeply affected families in my home State of Ohio as well as families all across this Nation.    What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?

11497630025	100000	Thank you, Congressman Conyers.    This is, in fact, one of my top priorities as Attorney General. And I'm incredibly proud to say that the Department of Justice has already begun the type of outreach that I was discussing at that particular event.    Through our COPS Office, in particular, the Community-Oriented Policing Service Office, we reach out directly to police departments across the country and offer technical assistance, we offer training, we offer peer-to-peer support.    We have found that an incredibly effective way to share information within the law enforcement community is peer-to-peer, police-officer-to-police-officer, chief-to-chief. And so we work with the departments that have, in fact, made great strides in the area of police-community relations and seek to match them up with other departments who are having challenges in this area and who would be receptive to their input.    I also, as I noted in my opening statement, have been on a six-city community policing tour. And as I talk with residents, with young people, elected leaders, I also talk with police officers. I do meet with chiefs and supervisors, but I also talk to the rank-and-file, the officers who are on the beats of our cities, to get their ideas as to what has worked in their city, as to why a positive relationship has developed in the cities where they have had challenges and where they have had struggles.    I have listened to their stories of commitment and dedication and to their embrace of community policing and concern for residents as a program and policy that makes policing more efficient and that makes communities safer. And I'm incredibly proud to support those efforts.	Thank you very much, Chairman Goodlatte.    Attorney General Lynch, I want to thank you again for speaking at my panel at this year's Congressional Black Caucus Legislative Forum. It was marvelous.

11635589121	100000	So, I have spoken to my Russian counterpart no less than three times on the issue of Venezuela and their interference, the fact that they are undermining Venezuelan democracy. It was met with precisely what you would expect from them.    We are doing our level best to push back against the capacity of Cuba, who has had intelligence officers and security officers on the ground there today protecting Maduro. It shocks me that the Venezuelan military will tolerate these foreigners, right, coming to run their security service. As a former U.S. Army officer, it would have been embarrassing if a third country had to come in and provide security for the leadership of our country. But that is where we are today.    We are doing our level best to put sanctions in place, to put restrictions in place, and to, more importantly, build our coalition, not just in South America and Central America with the OAS and the Lima Group, but European countries from all the around the world who understand that democratic Venezuela is the only path forward and Maduro has to go before we can get there.	And I am going to give a shoutout to you because I had the opportunity to travel with you for a better part of a day. What I saw you and your team doing I thought was pretty phenomenal, because I have never seen this done before where you were traveling within the States to promote what the State Department does. You were talking to young students to get them involved in thinking about going into a career in the State Department. And I commend you and your team for doing that, because I look back when I grew up as a pretty sheltered life. I did not even think that was a realm of possibility. Again, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that.    I share the same beliefs as Mr. Sires, of my colleague, in regards to Russia, Cuba, China, and Iran, that there is maybe a destabilizing, coordinated effort underway to destabilize the Western Hemisphere. And I think you and I have talked about this, that Venezuela could be but the rubicon, because if Venezuela fails, it will show that Cuba, you know, they cannot survive because they are the ones that have been propping that up.

11497630008	1000	Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.    With regard to the Department of Justice enforcement of the gun laws, we take those gun laws very seriously and are committed to using the full panoply of laws and regulations on the books.    We typically use those laws at the Federal level in conjunction with our many and numerous violent crime initiatives. For example, in my former position as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, many of our gang cases also carried with them firearms charges. They would not necessarily be the lead charge, they may not be reflected in the data that you have, but they certainly are an important tool in every prosecutor's arsenal in combating violent crime.    In the discussions----	Well, I think we'll be vulnerable, too, when it comes to people from Syria, when we can't get access to those databases because the country is in disarray, and we can't even gather information, fresh, new, because we can't access the people that we could talk to.    Let me move on to another topic. The latest available data from the Justice Department shows that, during fiscal year 2015, the government reported 6,002 new weapons convictions. This number is down 5.8 percent from the previous fiscal year, when the number of convictions totaled 6,373. Compared to 5 years ago, when there were 7,101 weapons convictions, the number for fiscal year 2015 is down 15.5 percent. Convictions over the past year are lower than they were 10 years ago. Overall, the data show that convictions of this type, weapons violations, are down 34.8 percent from the level of 9,206 reported in 2005.    The President has repeatedly called for new gun control laws, yet your department has seen weapons prosecutions and convictions fall to levels not seen in over a decade.    How do you explain such a precipitous drop in weapon prosecutions and convictions under this Administration? And why is such little emphasis placed on these types of prosecutions, when the President has called for yet more laws when the current laws are not being enforced?

I want to follow up on what my friend from north Texas talked about on his cartoon. Next month, the general data protection regulation, the GDPR, goes into effect in the European Union. The GDPR is pretty prescriptive on how companies treat consumer data, and it makes it clear that consumers need to be in control of their own data.    Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook has committed to abiding to these consumer protections in Europe, and you face large penalties if they don't. In recent days, you have said that Facebook intends to make the same settings available to users everywhere, not only in Europe.

The Secretary simply acknowledged a single portion of the ""question"" by letting Mr.Crawford of GA know that they were number one in cotton.

11530956005	1000	Mr. Chairman, you are right that we don't sell any data, and I would say that we do try to explain what we do as time goes on. It is a broad system. You know, every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our products, whether it is Facebook or Messenger or Instagram or WhatsApp, to put in a piece of content, whether it is a photo that they want to share or a message they want to send someone, and every time there is a control right there about who you want to share it with.    Do you want to share it publicly to broadcast it out to everyone? Do you want to share it with your friends, a specific group of people? Do you want to message it to just one person or a couple of people? That is the most important thing that we do, and I think that in the product that is quite clear.    I do think that we can do a better job of explaining how advertising works. There is a common misperception, as you say, that is just reported--often keeps on being reported--that for some reason we sell data.    I can't be clearer on this topic: We don't sell data. That is now how advertising works. And I do think we could probably be doing a clearer job explaining that, given the misperceptions that are out there.	And you have recently said that you and Facebook have not done a good job of explaining what Facebook does. And so, back in 2012 and 2013, when a lot of this scraping of user and friend data was happening, did it ever cross your mind that you should be communicating more clearly with users about how Facebook is monetizing their data?

11635589079	100000	So, you asked three questions there, I believe. The first one was what was my knowledge base. I think at that time I knew most of what had taken place, although I do not recall the exact sequence. I certainly have learned more about that since then. I have learned additional facts since that moment in time.    The second question was did I discuss the murder. The answer is yes. I think I said it that day, that I had discussed the murder with him.    And then, the third question is how will we hold them accountable. You have seen the Trump Administration do just that with respect to 17 individuals. We are continuing all across the government, certainly with overt means and all the tools that we have in our capacity, to learn more facts about this. President Trump has made very clear that we will continue to work to identify those who are responsible for Jamal Khashoggi's murder and hold them accountable. We will. I stand by that today. I am sure President Trump will as well.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome back, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for being here.    Mr. Secretary, I do not want to talk at a political level today with you. I want to talk from the heart. And I want to talk about a matter of justice on behalf of one of my constituents well known to you. I want to show you a picture.    This picture took place on November 19th, 2017 in my district. I am holding a cane because I had had a bad accident at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, a few months before and I still needed a cane to hobble around, not the most flattering picture of me.    Next to me is a man named Jamal Khashoggi. He is a mild-mannered man. He and I are discussing Middle East issues. He was a Saudi citizen, family, children, had on occasion worked for the Saudi government or for members of the royal family. He was mild-mannered, soft-spoken, and a moderate critic of the Kingdom. He wanted to see modernization. He wanted to see reforms. He was a columnist sometimes for The Washington Post, our local newspaper here in Washington.    On October 2d, 2018, 11 months later, my constituent, a legal resident of the United States who lived in Tysons Corner in Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia, was lured into the sovereign territory, the consulate of the Saudi government in Istanbul because he was seeking papers to get remarried. He had his fiancee outside waiting for him. He had been to the consulate before, and they had lulled him into believing he would be safe. But, of course, he was not.    What we know was that, on that day, two planes under the control of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia flew in with two teams whose objective was to either kidnap or kill Mr. Khashoggi. One presumes the objective involved killing because, not a diplomatic tool normally, they brought with them a bone saw. We know all of that because of revelations from Turkey. But those revelations, as I understand it, have been confirmed by our intelligence community; you would know better than I.    Nonetheless, what we do know is the Saudi government lied consistently. They lied about whether he safely left the consulate that day, knowing full well he did not. They lied about his murder. They lied about the conspiracy to murder him. They lied about who did it and how it was done.    And I guess I want to show you another picture, Mr. Secretary. This is a picture that took place 14 days after the murder. And that shows you and the Crown Prince, who many believe orchestrated and ordered the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, my constituent. And I guess what this picture raises is a question. At what point, as Americans, do we insist that the inalienable rights enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, all three of which were denied my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi, when do they trump diplomatic nicety? Is there ever a time when we are going to, as a country, insist, you know what, we are not going to do business as normal and we are going to hold you to account?    Now, at that meeting, you said, I believe, that they would be held to account, but you were meeting with a man who was assuring you they would be held to account, when he is himself suspected strongly of having orchestrated the murder. And so, I guess I want to ask you, Mr. Secretary, were you aware of the fact at that point of the gruesome details of the murder of my constituent, Mr. Khashoggi? Did you discuss that murder with the Crown Prince? And how are we going, moving forward, to hold the Crown Prince and the Saudi government responsible for one of the most grisly episodes ever to occur in a consulate or an embassy in our diplomatic experience?

11420722064	100000	Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.    And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?

You want to make sure that you gather all the facts that are available so that you have a complete and full record on which to make the determinations. You want to protect people's privacy because many times people will provide us information and you don't want to start going out and telling everybody who is talking to us, who is not talking to us. You don't want to have some witnesses infected by what other witnesses have said so that you can get the pure Statements from each type of witness.    Some people, you may just want to make sure they are protected because there are allegations about them that turn out not to be true. And it is not fair for those to be published.

He didn't like that; he thought his words were pretty good. Among those words were Americans were entitled to life, liberty. Now, here the editorial committee did not act. He said and the pursuit of happiness. But it sounds like some people would substitute for that an unfettered and unquestioned access to 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) tax exempt status.

It is the campaign intervention that if it becomes your primary activity, you, in fact, are not eligible to be a 501(c)(4). There obviously are complicated terms. We provided better guidance and we have also provided improved and new supervision for any determination that is going to be delayed.

11635589012	100000	So, the first thing we did is we identified it, something previous Administrations were loath to do. I get it. We have important economic interests with China. Many American jobs depend on that. President Trump is doing his level best to set the trade relationship so that it is fair and reciprocal. So, I would describe that as the first thing the Administration did.    The second thing is we recognize this is a great power battle and we are engaged in it across the world. It is our support of ASEAN. It is identifying the threat from Chinese State-owned enterprise technology companies, sharing that with countries in the Middle East and in Europe, identifying these risks, so that Western democracies around the world will wake up to the risks and will push back.    And you mentioned One Belt One Road, in particular. We are doing our best to make sure that there are Western competitors every place there is a project that China is putting forth. We are happy to compete. If it is fair, transparent, open transaction, you know, the Chinese may win a few, but I am very confident that American businesses will do incredibly well there.    What we have seen is just the opposite. We have seen transactions that were not straight-up, that were not fair, that were designed with a national security interest, and not an economic interest for the people of their country. The State Department has shared with these countries and their people and their leadership the risks from entering into these. And frankly, I think countries throughout Asia/Southeast Asia are waking up to this concern as well.	And thank you. I think it is an historic opportunity for the region, the hemisphere. I think it will transform Venezuela, which is now a failed State. It was a prosperous nation. Now, 20 years later, it is in utter chaos. And I think it would also impact Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia. It could really transform the Western Hemisphere and be a major foreign policy victory.    On China, as I get my threat briefings, Islamist terror has always been the focus, but it seems to me that China now is becoming more the No. 1 threat in nation States. Can you tell me about the threat from China? In particular, what I am concerned about is the One Belt One Road Initiative. You know, their theft of intellectual property--they are in our medical institutions, our universities. But the One Belt One Road, they are literally overleveraging countries, and particularly in Africa, too, where they can take over these countries without a shot fired.

11525545000	100000	Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.	Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.    The chair reminds Members they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the order of arrival, and I appreciate Members' understanding.    And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Secretary, again, thanks for being here, and we are looking forward to working with you across the myriad of issues that we have, going forward. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I represent a lot of cotton farmers. I believe we had a very elegant fix to the issue with respect to cotton, to the STAX program, that didn't work. It should have been in the omnibus bill, but our colleagues, particularly two of them in the Senate, refused to see the wisdom of that, and for their own purposes and own benefit, didn't let that happen. Now we are left with the same wreck in cotton. I hope I can count on working with you across whatever tools that we have. Obviously, we think that cottonseed could go under the title I program, and although there could be a lot of challenges with making that happen, we would look forward to working with you either on that or other issues with respect to getting some help to offset what China and India have done to the market, that will allow our producers to compete properly.    I would like to turn now to the Trade Under Secretary that you have announced. Obviously, as authorizers of the 2014 Farm Bill, we thank you very much for seeing the wisdom of that. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you see your Under Secretary working with the other array of trade entities, whether it is the USTR, Department of Commerce, whoever that might be, and the role that that Under Secretary would play, not only in making sure the negotiations go the correct way, but also making sure that the Administration keeps a close eye on enforcement of the various trade things that we have out there.

We are doing everything we can to persuade people and, again, we are willing to be shown, I am an output kind of guy, so wait and watch and see what I do.

11635589016	100000	Yes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary of State, thank you and welcome.    I want to talk a little bit about the Western Hemisphere and what is going on. I see a bigger plan in what is going on in Venezuela I think than most people. I see a lot of similarities of what happened with Cuba and what is happening in Venezuela. In Cuba, they allowed the people to leave that were disenchanted with the government. In Venezuela, there are 5,000 people leaving every day. They expect, by the end of this year, to be about 5 million people that have left Venezuela, those who are disenchanted with this government.    I really believe that there is a bigger plan here to destabilize the Western Hemisphere with what is going on in Venezuela. You have a million people putting a great deal of pressure on Colombia, and they have opened their doors and they have done a great job in helping these people. You have 700,000 people going into Peru. You have people all the way down to Argentina. Some of these countries cannot absorb the quantity of people that are leaving Venezuela daily. So, to me, I think this is part of a bigger plan to destabilize this whole region.    It continues to keep us busy. It continues to make America the bad apple in all this. And I would hope that we will continue to put pressure on Maduro. I do not believe in military action, but I do believe that sanctions will be effective and working with the Lima Group will be very effective.    This afternoon, I am meeting with Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Guaido. She is very concerned about her husband. She feels that any day now they are going to pick him up, and God knows where they are going to put him.

11531349088	100000	Yes, I will. We think we need the leverage ratio as a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital. We think that the current calibration of the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio is not appropriate. We are looking at a recalibration that would address that exact concern.	I want to move onto another topic, but continuing the discussion on the importance of getting our regulations right to benefit Main Street and rural America.    Minnesota's 6th Congressional District, which I represent, is home to some of the finest and most productive farmers and manufacturers in the world. Many of these same individuals and businesses, who are making such a positive economic impact on my district, are inadvertently harmed by the current formulation of the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) that fails to recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin.    This bank capital rule is increasing clearance costs for farmers and manufacturers, making it more expensive for them to use the cleared derivatives market.    I hope that as you and your colleagues at the Fed review the SLR that you come to the same conclusion that a coalition of Republican and Democrat members on this committee have, that we must recognize the exposure-reducing nature of initial client margin in a revised bank capital rule.

The reason there is a limitation is the agency does not have servers large enough to sustain the retention of all emails. A decision was made 2 years ago when people looked at that and it was determined it would cost anywhere from $10 million to $30 million to upgrade the system so that, in fact, all emails on the server would be preserved.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that they want the truth, that they want transparency and fair oversight, yet the Democrats' witness to testify before Congress today is none other than a scorned man who is going to prison for lying to Congress.    Let that sink in. He is going to prison for lying to Congress, and he is the star witness to Congress.    If you read the sentencing report on Mr. Cohen words like ``deceptive'' and ``greedy'' are scattered throughout that report. It paints a picture of a narcissist, a bully who cannot tell the truth, whether it is about the President or about his own personal life. But today he is the majority party's star witness.    If the Democrats were after the truth, they'd have an honest person here testifying. And if they were really after the truth, they'd not restrict the questioning to just a few topics. But let's take a look at those restricted topics.    Mr. Chairman, the first topic in your limited scope that I can ask Mr. Cohen is about the President's debts. But, Mr. Chairman, didn't Mr. Cohen plead guilty to lying to banks about his personal finances? So we are asking a guy going to jail for lying about his debts to comment about the President's debts. He is the expert.    Mr. Chairman, your next couple of topics say that I can ask Mr. Cohen about the President's compliance with financial disclosures and campaign finance laws. But didn't Mr. Cohen on two occasions break campaign finance law with his own donations? So again, the majority party's star witness on the President's compliance is a guy who broke compliance laws himself.    Mr. Chairman, you graciously allow us to ask questions of Mr. Cohen on the President's dealings with the IRS and tax law. Your star witness here broke the law with regards to the IRS at least five times. He pled guilty on cheating on his taxes, lying to the IRS. He's the best witness you got?    Next up, with the permission of the chairman I get to ask Mr. Cohen about his perspective on the President's business dealings. Let me get this straight. The witness lied to multiple financial institutions to get loans to pay off other loans just to keep himself afloat, and he is going to be the expert on business practices.    Obviously, Mr. Chairman, the witness may produce documents that he suggests incriminates the President, yet he lies to banks. All of those lies were done on fraudulent documents, documents that he forged. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. Apparently he even lied about delivering his own child, which his wife had to correct the record.    Ladies and gentlemen, how on earth is this witness credible? With all the lies and deception, the self-serving fraud, it begs the question, what is the majority party doing here? No one can see this guy as credible. He will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. He is a fake witness, and his presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people see through this. I know the people back in Tennessee will.    And with that statement, sir, I have a few questions for the witness.

I'm not sure if the witness is lying in this case, but the question seems very straightforward to me. So unless he was literally unable to hear the question be asked, I suspect he doesn't want to answer that question. I am not sure about that though, as I don't know how loudly or clearly the questioner speaks. Koskinen appears to not have understood the question at hand. They have seemed defensive throughout the hearing so I believe they were evading a question that could make them look bad. The witness appears to be avoiding this question altogether.

11636001069	110000	Ranking Member Collins, the court had a sealed indictment that after Mr. Stone's arrest was unsealed. Consistent with all of its prior indictments, the DOJ's basic policy for transparency in criminal cases is that the indictment is posted on the DOJ web page promptly after it is unsealed, and then media outlets were notified.    We do not know of any, and I do not know of any, other Special Counsel's Office notice or DOJ notice to media outlets regarding Mr. Stone's indictment or his arrest and otherwise--you know, I really, as I sit here today, don't have any other information that I can talk about regarding Mr. Stone.

And as you noted, certainly it's the Department's position that as a general matter all who appear before tribunals, whether they be courts, administrative bodies, tend to have a more efficient process and a fairer process if they are represented by counsel. Certainly we have statutes and laws to that effect with regard to adults, criminal matters, and the like.    For those children, also it certainly would seem to increase efficiency of the entire process to have counsel.

11426003062	101000	Thank you for that question.    We have agreed with our regulators to go back to 2011. We voluntarily said last week that we will go back to 2010 and 2009. I've told our team to leave no stone unturned. And if we find a situation where a customer is harmed that goes back prior to that, we will make it right for that customer.	Well, it seems very, very suspicious that your largest sale was right after your $1.8 trillion bank was turned into a school for scoundrels.    You acknowledge that your bank fired over 5,300 people who got caught willfully defrauding your customers. And a recent lawsuit alleges that you fired even more people because they refused to willfully defraud customers. And then you blame the low-level people, you fire them. You make profits, then you dump the stock.    So I just have to say that it seems that when you found out about the fake accounts, instead of helping your customers, you first helped yourself.    So, moving right along to the next question, Mr. Stumpf, you've said that Wells Fargo is conducting a review of all accounts going back to 2009 in order to identify any scam accounts. But last week, in the Senate hearings, you were asked if you would extend the review period to before 2009, and you refused to commit to extending the review period back to even earlier.    So if you were presented with hardcore evidence that Wells was engaged in some of these practices, these illegal scams prior to 2009, would you change your mind about extending the review?

What I would say on this issue certainly is, as the Administration has stated, the closure of Guantanamo Bay is something that is part of the Administration's policy, and the Department of Justice supports that, as well.    At this point in time, I believe the current state of the law is that individuals are not transferred from Guantanamo to U.S. shores. That position is reiterated by the legislation that you mention. And my understanding, as you indicated, is that I do believe the President has indicated that he would sign that.    And, certainly, it's the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard to that issue.	Thank you very much.    Madam Attorney General, welcome. We hope to be seeing you for a bit, at least for the next 14 months.    I have a question relative to the issue of the Guantanamo detainees. Congress recently passed and the President is expected to sign into law legislation that explicitly prohibits the use of Federal funds to move detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States.    Former White House Counsel Gregory Craig recently wrote an op-ed arguing that the law is unconstitutional and that President Obama can legally ignore it.

11531349065	100100	Thank you, Mr. Royce. Of course we don't do fiscal policy at the Fed, but I will accept your invitation and just say that it is very important that the Federal Government and government generally be on a sustainable fiscal path, meaning as the baby boomer generation retires, we will need to address the significant fiscal issues that are coming to us over time. I think it is important that Congress do that.    At the same time, the debt ceiling should be something that we always raise in a timely fashion. There is no other country in the world that has a separate vote over whether to pay bills that we have already agreed to incur. I think the United States has never defaulted on a principal or interest payment and never should.    I think doing so would be something I would really hate to see and could bring very significant consequences.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being with us here today. I also wanted to thank you for another effort you undertook, and that was in 2011. You spent a considerable amount of time with members of the House, trying to walk them through the debate that we had on raising the debt ceiling.    You were trying to get us focused on all the unintended consequences, which would occur if we did not raise that debt ceiling, and I very much appreciated the time, effort, and facts that you put forward.    You have a new voice now at the Fed. I assume your opinions on the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling remain. I know that in August, it looks as though the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, or have to roll over, $500 billion of debt in August.    If we are in a quasi-default situation in August, then clearly it is a real question as who would want to purchase that debt and at what cost would they purchase that debt? Clearly a premium on that, a 10 percent premium, it would be a $50 billion hit right there to the interest expense, but there is much more than that that would befall the impact on our markets and, frankly, at corporate debt.    Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?	Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?

11525545203	101000	I will, Congressman. Again, my mantra has been sound science, fact-based, data-driven, customer-focused decisions. And that is what we hope to do. That is a balance, obviously. As you know, today, we have used science in a way that sometimes comes from an ideological perspective, and the sound science definition is in the eye of the beholder. We have to make sure at USDA we have an agenda-less investigation, and things that come out without a predetermined conclusion over our scientific discovery that help us lead. I am not smart enough to create, intuitively, programs and policies without data, without science, without facts to do that. I agree with you.    The other part about that, when you talked about the agency that promulgated that, Secretary Price and I served in the state Senate. We have already talked about some interagency working between delineating FDA's role and USDA's role in some of these areas. The good news about the President's interagency task force over rural prosperity was, we get to talk about with different people how your rules affect my people, and how my rules may affect your people in that regard. We want to collaborate in a holistic approach to government, I think like I have not seen before; that is the Secretary of the Interior, FDA, HHS, Commerce and Energy, and those working together, the EPA Administrator. I told Scott Pruitt, I said my guys are much more excited about you than they are me, those folks are interagency.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, I am so glad to see that you are now the Agriculture Secretary. And everything I have read about you was excellent, and just hearing your testimony is really reassuring to me. I have always said it should be a prerequisite that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture should have a farm background. I know you have an excellent track record in farming and agribusiness, and I am looking forward to working with you.    I represent 35 counties in Kentucky, 35 rural counties, and there are six Congressional districts in Kentucky. And when you look at the total agriculture sales in Kentucky, the overwhelming majority of those sales come from the First Congressional District of Kentucky. We have poultry, we have beef cattle, corn, wheat, horses, and a lot of tobacco. Tobacco is still a very important crop in Kentucky.    My question is, in many instances the previous Administration promulgated regs that were unachievable. For example, the FDA pushed forward a proposed rule at the very last minute that would limit NNN, I am going to say it, N-Nitrosonornicotine, in smokeless tobacco to levels lower than growers could achieve. Will you commit to use sound, scientific data in rulemaking, and work with farmers and ranchers in drafting regulations to ensure that they are realistic and practical?

11420722033	101000	Thank you, Congressman, for the question.    Let me be clear that my decision was to accept the recommendation of the team of agents and investigators who worked on this. And these are the career attorneys as well as the dedicated investigators, including the FBI Director, who worked on this matter for over a year.    They've reviewed the facts. They followed the facts. They looked at the law. They've applied the facts to that law and came up with a unanimous recommendation----	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being with us today.    You are in charge of the Department of Justice. The buck stops with you. And I'm concerned that you keep on saying that you have deferred the authority that by law is yours to Director Comey.    Let me give an example. Mr. Comey has said that Secretary Clinton was extremely careless in her handling of highly classified, very sensitive information. Now, the criminal statute uses the word ``gross negligence.'' And I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference between ``gross negligence'' and ``extremely careless'' is unless one really wants to parse some words.    Now, secondly, the misdemeanor statute does not require intent. It's a strict liability statute, and it relates to the removal and retention of classified information. So it doesn't matter whether Secretary Clinton had the intent to do that or not; the fact is that the FBI said that she did it.    Now, I think that what Director Comey has said is that Secretary Clinton's actions essentially meet the definition for prosecution under the statute.

11388494100	1001	Needless to say, I wasn't around in 1959, when that regulation was given to the IRS.	Now, if I said to my spouse, honey, we have an exclusive relationship, and I mean by that 49 percent, I would probably have problems in my relationship. To her and to me exclusively means just you all the time, 100 percent. So how in the world did we get to a situation where the IRS, on its own, outside of statutory authority, decided to interpret this as primarily? Because, to me, that is part of the problem. Exclusively ought to mean exclusively. And if Congress wants to change that, we should change the law. But I don't remember Congress investing IRS with the authority to actually decide to interpret it radically different, not just kind of a little fudge factor here. This is radically different. And it seems to me therein is the problem, because clearly some of these organizations are not exclusively social welfare agents, I mean, clearly, they are largely designed to be political, partisanly political, that concern the chairman has, overt partisan communication, and I share that concern. And all too many of these organizations hide under the umbrella of social welfare when in fact what they really mean is partisan political activity. Can you address this dilemma for me, how the IRS could possibly take the word exclusively and reinterpret it to mean mostly, sometimes, just shy of 50 percent, primarily?

11525545011	110000	Absolutely. I think it is a reasonable request. As you know, I didn't get to the burned areas, but my first trip outside was Kansas City. I heard directly from many of those affected about that. And that is a reasonable request, certainly one that we would consider very, very seriously in a reasonable request effort, because we know that grass doesn't just necessarily grow right back on those kind of issues.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, it is indeed good to see you.    And you mentioned a moment ago on some of the burning issues, let's talk about that for a moment. I think most of my colleagues are aware that in the early part of March this year, a series of wildfires burned over 1 1/2 million acres of land in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, and the Texas Panhandle. And these fires killed thousands of head of cattle, destroyed hundreds and hundreds of miles of fence, impacted countless families, businesses, and it is hard to estimate the impact on the smaller communities.    On the 4th of April, 2017, USDA authorized emergency grazing on Conservation Reserve Program lands located in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas for 90 days. The flexibility to graze on CRP was, and is critical to the survival of many operations throughout my district. And that being said, it will take longer than 90 days to regrow the foliage, rebuild the facilities needed to maintain, contain, and care for the surviving livestock. And last week I, along with Representative Marshall on this Committee, and Representative Thornberry, sent you a letter requesting extension of the emergency grazing authorization past the current 90 day authorization. Would this extension be something that you would be willing to consider, Mr. Secretary?	Would this extension be something that you would be willing to consider, Mr. Secretary?

Food banks, one of the things we can do in food banks is develop a wonderful, progressive food waste program where many of these foods we ought to be ashamed as a nation over our waste of some products, while some people go hungry. Developing programs where we can coordinate with our food banks in these under-served areas with safe food waste issues, policies that make sense, and maybe removing some of the things that don't make sense, maybe one of the areas we can work on together.	I represent northwest Florida, but one of the things that is interesting, within my district, one in every four Floridians have been on SNAP at some point over the last 12 months; twice the national average.

11531349027	101000	Thank you, Chairman Barr. It is very hard to trace through the effects of a change in tax policy into things like wage growth in the economy. But let me try.    Lower corporate taxes should lead to higher investment. The effect is not easy to estimate but you would think and the studies find that it should lead to higher investment. Higher investment should lead to higher productivity over time, and higher productivity should lead to higher wages over time.    It is very hard to put your hands on exactly how much that would be, but higher productivity, of course, is very, very welcome, and will be driven by higher investment.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman Powell, congratulations again on your confirmation. I appreciate your commitment in our conversations to transparency and your demonstration of that commitment to date to clearly communicate the Fed's monetary policy trajectory.    You have noted on numerous occasions that the remaining slack that may exist in the labor market is at least in part attributable to stagnant wage growth. In your confirmation hearing, a Senator on the Banking Committee cited a 2016 Fed research paper concluding that corporate tax cuts do not translate into higher wages.    But we have seen a wave of corporate announcements of bonuses and raises since the tax cuts were enacted. Specifically over 4 million workers and counting have received over $3 billion in bonuses and raises during the last 8 weeks. The Labor Department recently announced the largest increase in wages since the end of the recession.    Based on these numbers, is the Senator in question, and are the Fed researchers that he cites, are they wrong and have tax cuts in fact helped increase wages as your testimony indicates that wages should be increasing at a faster pace as a result of a more stimulative fiscal policy?

11531504002	11000	Well, as you know, under the statute we have an ability to reset those volume obligations, and we are evaluating that. There is a cap of 15 billion for conventional presently. But another area, Mr. Chairman, that I know you have been interested in is high octane. And with respect to--it was mentioned in some other comments about the CAFE standards. There needs to be a serious consideration of us pursuing as a country fuel choices and options to meet those CAFE standards and provide high octane as an option to the American people. I think there is a potential that will serve both the ag sector as well at the auto sector and consumers across this country that we could pursue together.

11636001113	110000	Congressman, absolutely there is a connection between the drugs that are being imported through our southern border, which is a large majority of those drugs, and the opioid crisis we now face. In fact, I went to China in August as chief of staff for then General Sessions. He asked me to go to talk to the Chinese about what more they could do to reduce the amount of fentanyl that is being produced in China, and we had a nice dialogue with some high-level government officials. And the President, as you know, has agreed with General Xi to reduce fentanyl and eliminate fentanyl production in China. And one of the ways that China has agreed to do that was by scheduling the analogs of fentanyl. It is a very serious problem, and I know Ohio is dramatically affected by it.

11531504107	101000	If they provide the data and methodology to the Agency and the findings, it will be used.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Pruitt's ethical violations as the head of an Agency with a mission to protect the public's health demonstrate a concerning lack of integrity and a pattern of the rich and powerful putting their rich and powerful friends and their own self-interest above the interest of the public's health and at the expense of the common good. Clean air to breathe and safe water to drink is not a privilege only for the rich and powerful but a right for everyone, and the role of a public servant is to serve and protect the public, in particular the public's health.    However, the gross elimination of many public health protections are kickbacks to the rich lobbyists and corporation friends that have a real impact and I want to highlight one example. This week the EPA announced that it intends to limit the kind of scientific studies it will use in issuing new protections to only studies that make public the private, personal, confidential information of the people who participate in those studies.    Revealing that info is a clear ethical violation of any reputable research institutional review board in the United States. The type of studies you want to exclude are the same kind of scientific studies that were used to prove that lead in pipes and paints harm children and that secondhand smoke is a dangerous carcinogen. We are talking about landmark studies such as the Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study which proved a connection between air pollution and early death back in 1993. That just by living in a city with poor air quality your average life expectancy was lower than those who didn't. This study later became the basis of fine particulate matter regulations in the Clean Air Act.    When you were here in December, you and I spoke about fine particle matter which, thanks to studies based on confidential patient health information, we now know is associated with premature death, asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and respiratory diseases. You acknowledge these risks and agree that there is no safe level of fine particle pollution, but your new policy would block EPA from considering the studies that have shown these dangerous health implications.    So do you deny now that fine particle pollution has these health impacts, and will these new regulations cause your Agency to disregard these sentinel studies?

We did not deem him a candidate until later.    So even though you're running every 2 years, if you choose, there's a date that we take from when you're actually, like, a declared candidate. So that's No. 1.    No. 2, as I indicated, absolutely, as an adviser of the President, you can comment on policies. However, when you ask me about--talk about Democrats and people are running potentially for office, it gets a little bit closer, which is why we have a very robust advisory function.

Mr. Administrator, you are not the first person to be the victim of, for lack of a better term, Washington politics. You got picked to be the EPA Administrator because of the service you provided for the great State of Oklahoma in fighting some of the Obama administration radical clean air policies. You recommended and I support the recommendation that you made to the President that we withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement. That is a decision that most of the stakeholders at EPA violently oppose.    If you can't debate the policies in Washington, you attack the personality and that is what is happening to you.

11531504023	1100	This effort----	Well, then, I am concerned that you have no idea of what is going on in your name at your Agency, especially on an issue already under IG investigation. You have spent this week claiming to champion transparency, but on Tuesday you blocked the press from attending an event where you announced a new proposal that will severely limit the Agency's use of public health studies in policymaking.    When internal emails came out about this new policy last week, they revealed that it had been developed entirely by political staff, seemingly without a robust outside stakeholder process, and once the press started covering those emails they were removed from the Agency's public FOIA portal. I do not know if you were personally involved in the decision to remove those emails, but it certainly was not transparent.    Mr. Administrator, you like to claim that you support the rule of law and acknowledge the limits of EPA's authority. Many of our environmental statutes are clear. EPA must use the best available science as a foundation of policymaking. This proposal would prevent that.

11531504117	101000	Congress has been very helpful in providing a small refinery exemption under the statute. It is objectively determined. It is 75,000 barrels, as you indicated, production and we have received I think 24 applications in 2017, a little bit over 30 in 2018. And I would say to you that the volatility of the RIN trading platform is creating instability across the entire RFS discussion.    So it is really in everyone's best interest to get more clarity and confidence in how this RIN trading platform and relief needs to occur. It is going to benefit the ethanol industry, benefit the ag sector, and I think benefit those that are suffering with the RIN obligations. And so it is our hope that we can chart a path forward with Congress to achieve those kinds of outcomes.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Administrator, for coming before us. I think that was the first policy question you got from the other side of the aisle. Observation.    And to the public, I think this has been a lot of a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that we are seeing too often here in Washington that, unfortunately, I think works against civility and respect for people in public office. I am hoping we would be able to stay on policy today as much as we could, but I can see some just can't resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand.    So, having said all that, I thank you for what you have done. You have been able to stay disciplined on these policies. I know in West Virginia the impact that it has had on Brownfields Legislation of what you are doing on that I see the rollback of some of the regulatory reform that there is hope now. A lot of the people in the fossil fuel industry that they could see that deterioration in the past 8 years prior to that. There is some hope. We are seeing the economy start to rebound thanks to you and the administration of taking this fight on.    So I know that if I could, I know just as an example, here was an example that despite what has been said to the achievements that you have made that the EPA just awarded $1.9 million to research in drinking water having to do with Flint, that research in Flint. People are ignoring the progress that we are making and they are trying to make this another attack on President Trump, and unfortunately there are a lot of people that are going to go along with that.    So if we could, if I could get back to one of the things that has disturbed me some with some of the events over the last numbers of years was we had a good friend in Leslie Lampton who passed away last week. Lampton has Ergon Refinery located in Mississippi but they have the only refinery in West Virginia. It is a small, kind of a boutique operation at 23,000 barrels. I know the definition of a small refinery is 75,000 barrels, so they are a third of the size. But yet, so they are struggling meeting all of the qualifications, all the requirements of a major refinery.    Is there something that we could work together or something to help out these small refineries so that they can compete? Because they can't handle the RINs, they don't have a market for that with them. So is there something that we could be doing to help out these boutique refineries?

Koskinen makes an analogy to depict that he does not have evidence that Lerner committed a crime. Sarcastically responded that they have no evidence of anything. The witness was asked a direct question as to whether he knew a crime was committed, he eluded that question. A yes or no would have been suffice. He chose to be sarcastic.

The third, also from November 3rd: ``Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI and Justice Dept.''

11636001038	1010	Mr. Chairman, I see that your 5 minutes is up, and so--I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to a 5-minutes round, and----	I don't think you did, but let me just say this: Your iteration of the Department's longstanding policy appears designed to delay answering these questions as long as possible. I find that unacceptable. I understand the role of executive privilege and respect its value in our system of governance. However, Congress is a coequal branch of government. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight. This is a responsibility we take very seriously.    I have repeatedly tried to work with your office first in delaying the hearing until February and then in providing you our questions in advance. I did this because the executive branch's own rules governing assertion of privilege, which were issued by President Reagan and have been followed ever since, say that ultimately it is up to the President to decide whether or not he wants to assert executive privilege. You cannot repeat forever that the President might want to assert privilege.    I have given you a fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing and to speak with the White House in advance so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that. The Department's failure to do its due diligence here to me is deeply troubling. I do not believe that issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem, but I am going to give you the opportunity to rectify the situation.    After today's hearing, we will attempt to reach an accommodation with the Department to obtain answers to these questions. As part of that process, I ask for your commitment to return for a deposition before this committee in the coming weeks under oath with an understanding that the transcript will be released to the public as soon as practicable thereafter.    Any questions that are unanswered today or require consultation with the White House will be asked again at that proceeding, and I expect either a clean answer or a proper assertion of privilege claimed by the President. I would ask members on both sides of the aisle to make those questions clear for the record so we know what must be addressed at the future proceeding.

I do want to ask a couple questions about the Superfund program, particularly about your friend Mr. Albert Kelly, who you put in charge of the program despite his past. He was scheduled to appear before the committee in January, but he backed out at the last minute, citing travel obligations. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were disappointed in that, but Mr. Kelly sent a letter for the record that he would be willing to answer any and all of our questions regarding his lifetime ban from the banking industry and the illegal activities that led up to that.    It is now more than 3 months later, we have gotten no information from Mr. Kelly. We are told that political leadership has been preventing him from speaking with us, and if that is true, that is certainly disappointing. Two weeks ago, you were interviewed on Fox News by Ed Henry, and he asked you several questions about Mr. Kelly. In the interview, you said that the details of the settlement with the FDIC were private, and that none of us really know what happened.    So my question is, if Mr. Kelly is happy to share the details of his lifetime banking ban as a matter of transparency, is he not telling us the truth, or are you stopping him from doing that?

In her position I would hope she would agree with the director's outcome or could have changed the outcome. Therefore, she is avoiding so that she is not under oath committing to any one answer. Witness answers that they have different roles and that is why he cannot provide the same level of detail. Witness does not say if there is legal reason for this, he does not say yes or no to the question.	2

11637282031	1001	I'm not in a position to judge a statement like that. The way OSC works is we get complaints about statements. There is an investigation opened and started, and we don't just give----	Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note at the outset that, while the Hatch Act does not apply to--it does not Members of Congress. And it is always interesting to hear from my friends on the other side about the blending of political and official when every day we see examples of elected officials using their current positions to propel their Presidential campaign messages.    Having looked through the materials in preparation for this hearing, I can't help but feel that the Office of Special Counsel's interpretation of the Hatch Act means that President Trump's top advisers must subscribe to the legal and political fiction that you can decouple an opponent's Presidential campaign from their current elected position.    And my concern with the OSC's interpretation of the Hatch Act at least appears to be bipartisan. Chairman Cummings even sent a letter to OSC on December 7 of last year, and here's a direct statement: OSC's guidance is wrong. There is no limit that criticizing a policy of a sitting President or any other politician is a violation of the Hatch Act.    Apparently that applies unless you're an adviser to this President.    But all that aside, President Trump's advisers are going to continue to act as his surrogates. So going forward, maybe we can help--maybe this hearing can help us understand what a senior counselor to the President is allowed to say on TV or social media without personally offending Mr. Kerner or anybody else in the OSC's office.    So if we're talking about a sitting Senator and we're talking about Medicare for All, I mean, is it okay to say I hope Bernie Sanders Medicare for All proposal is purely campaign rhetoric, because if he were to introduce a Senate bill which actually provided a $32 trillion pay-for, people would have to give up the coverage they trust, and taxpayers would be on hook for trillions of dollars?

11525545039	110000	Absolutely. Again, many of the principles that were included in that, and actually in tandem with the renegotiation of NAFTA, you might see sort of a trilateral TPP. I am just suggesting that, but many of the principles that you all had in these negotiations are still viable, it is just a matter of fine-tuning those in a way that makes sense, I don't think this Administration is not against free trade at all, it really is more concerned to fair trade.	All right, let me move on because we don't get a lot of time here. Obviously, this is a conversation to be continued.    Trade, obviously, is very important. I was disappointed when the President withdrew from all the work that had been done on the TPP.

11497630047	110000	Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    This is, indeed, an important issue. Of course, we will always be deeply indebted to those first responders and brave men and women who risked their lives to search for and recover victims, to remove debris at the site, to carry out the recovery efforts at Ground Zero at 9/11.    It certainly is an important issue to me both as Attorney General and as someone who was in New York on 9/11 and who had friends and former colleagues who were in that group of those who were on the scene and who were involved in those activities. This is, in fact, a serious issue for those who were affected by it, and I greatly appreciate your expression of compassion for those who have fallen ill.    With respect to the bill that is currently pending, certainly, on behalf of the Department of Justice, we would do all that we could to work with you to make sure if there were any questions or issues they could be addressed. And we hope that there would be none.    This is, indeed, an important issue. And, again, I think it is something that deserves, certainly, strong review, serious consideration. And please let us know how the Department can be of assistance to any of the Members as they consider this important issue.	I thank the Chairman.    And I thank the Attorney General.    Madam Attorney General, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice established and oversaw a victims' compensation fund that provided more than $7 billion to families who lost loved ones on that day.    In the years after the attacks, it became clear that thousands of first responders and survivors continued to suffer major health consequences from the attacks and their aftermath. Thousands of lawsuits were filed against contractors and others by these victims.    In 2010, Congress enacted the James Zadroga Act, which provided essential healthcare services to those in need and reopened the Victim Compensation Fund to those families whose losses became apparent after September 11, providing them an alternative to litigation. In the last 5 years, the Victim Compensation Fund has provided nearly 6,300 first responders and survivors with $1.4 billion in compensation determinations. Since we enacted the bill, I am aware of no further 9/11-related lawsuits.    Despite its current success, on September 30, 2015, Congress allowed the VCF and the World Trade Center Health Program to expire. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in the House to permanently reauthorize the Victim Compensation Fund and the World Trade Center Health Program. The bill now has the cosponsorship of 247 cosponsors, a majority of the House, including more than 50 Republicans, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 65 cosponsors.    If Congress fails to act, thousands of first responders and survivors will lose access to compensation on which they depend to support their families when they are tragically gone. The VCF is preparing to shutter its operations once it has processed existing claims. If the VCF is not fully funded and reauthorized, the first responders and survivors who have already received the notice of their compensation could actually see that amount cut by up to 50 percent.    We are literally talking about taking money out of the hands of a sick police officer. I am deeply saddened to think that is how Congress plans to remember the heroes of 9/11.    Attorney General Lynch, do you agree that this is not the proper way to honor the heroes of 9/11?

11525545051	100100	Well, as a veterinarian, I obviously understand the benefit of vaccination, and the fact that we cannot psychologically afford even a foot-and-mouth disease scare here at all. We saw what BSE did to us, and we talked about that earlier, but I want to compliment you on how well you listened in Iowa. I was delighted to be in your district, and to move up from the cows on the farm, a very innovative family farm operation there, up to the APHIS Ames facility. I was very impressed. We talked specifically about vaccine banks there. They are a repository, along with Iowa State, a USDA facility responsible for vaccination protocols as well. I am hopeful, I look at vaccine banks as insurance, and you can't have your house burn down and take out insurance after the fact and have it pay off. You have to have vaccines and you have to have a vaccine availability ahead of the time. I look at it as a wise insurance program.	I want to start out with a retraction of a statement that I made when I first heard of your name coming forward as Secretary of Agriculture, and I will say I thought it was candidly, but I said I hope it is more than about peaches and peanuts. And you came to Iowa 11 days after confirmation, and it was absolutely clear it is much, much more than about peaches and peanuts. And I was gratified to hear many of the things that you had to say there in the heart of my district. And I just wrote down a few of them here from memory. There will be a lot of colloquialisms that will come from our new Secretary of Agriculture, and it adds a lot of flavor to our rural life. For example, I am speaking of the trade that you grow it, we will sell it. I like that bumper sticker, and I have every confidence that will be the policy coming out of the USDA.    And now, one of the other things you said is an oath is stronger even than a contract. That stuck in my mind as the piece of wisdom that a lot of us can apply to our job here every single day. And let's see, the equipment might be a little different but the people are the same. That is another thing that is true all across this country, and it is something we can keep in mind here in this Agriculture Committee. And I will leave out the full story about the cow's tail, but that made it all real, Mr. Secretary.    So I wanted to welcome you to this Agriculture Committee, and I look forward to many discussions that we will have in the future years, and they will be very productive.    One of the things on my mind though as far as an issue is concerned is the fear of foot-and-mouth disease, and it is some of the things that we have been working on for I would say a year and a half or 2 years now in my district and beyond. That is the worst calamity we can imagine as far as biosecurity situation is concerned. I have been doing some work there through Iowa State, and the request that I see across the industry is for a vaccine bank that starts out at about $150 million, and then sells off some of that vaccine and keeps always a fresh supply there. We have another way to go where we can genetically design a vaccine that is going to be cheaper and can be reproduced more quickly.    You went up the road to APHIS and I wasn't able to tag along on that stop, but I wondered if you had any fresh thoughts on FMD and what you might be able to tell this Committee on how you would approach our preparations for potential calamity?

The 3-day waiting period is part of congressional action that has already been voted on by Congress. And, certainly, it is a fact that, with the rise in purchases and the increased use on the NICS background system, there is ever more use of that system.    We are working to improve the NICS system to make it as efficient as possible. We've expanded the number of personnel working on those background checks. We are working also to improve the automated portion of the NICS system so that the dealers who go through the system will be able to get information more quickly and to be able to respond, either by proceeding or denying a sale or in other ways as appropriate.    So we are working within the system as it is currently structured. In order to change that, it would require congressional action.	A loophole in Federal law allows the transfer of a firearm to anybody after 3 business days, even if a background check is not complete. Last year, the FBI concluded the suspect in the shooting in Charleston was able to purchase a gun through this loophole.    Should that policy change?

11525545128	101000	Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well. All of that is complicated, complex, but it needs to be all of our business about that.	California is number one in medium grade. Thank you for meeting the California folks earlier this week as well too; for rice. We just need a little more help in the exports on that, getting more of that product into Japan. There was a lot of disappointment over the TPP with only opening up another 50,000 tons, which I and about seven other growers could grow that ourselves. That didn't mean a whole lot, so maybe as that comes back around, we can see a little more entry for rice as well as other exports.    Last, I would just like to hear what you think on this. We did hear a little mention of SNAP earlier. We have had a lot of hearings on that during this last year. Very comprehensive. And it keeps coming up the issue of SNAP, which is a program this Committee very strongly supports, but the way it is targeted, and there are a lot of issues with some of the products SNAP is being used for; soda and candy, and things like that, that aren't generally healthy, where the original intent was ag products that come from here. Could you just touch in general on what you feel the direction should be with SNAP, and what kind of products we should be using with that? Thank you.

11532380118	110000	Well, many States have capital punishment. The Federal Government has capital punishment for a number of offenses, and it is specifically controlled. We have within the Department a recommendation process through our appointed committee to seek or not seek a death penalty when a case is charged. Sometimes it's a complex thing.    But I believe the death penalty, the Federal death penalty, is a part of our law. I think it's a legitimate penalty. It's constitutional. And we will do our duty, even in those circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty.	Okay. It seems to me that there's always been a tremendous amount of gray area in that whole field, which I think, as a Nation, you know, we need to look much more closely at, both from the State's point of view and the Federal Government point of view. But that's just my feeling on that.    I'm running out of time. I had about four other things, but let me just go to one final thing here.    I've been very involved in the area of victims' rights. I was the--following Henry Hyde's leadership on this, introduced a victims' rights constitutional amendment years back, various pieces of legislation on victims' rights. And I've also worked closely with the parents of murdered children. And when you talk about something that affects one's family, there's nothing that affects a family more adversely than something like that happening.    And we still have capital punishment on the books, both at the Federal level and many of our States. Yet these families are dragged left and right, up and down, back and forth, into hearing after hearing. These cases can drag on for more than 20 years before the imposition of capital punishment actually occurs. And, in many instances, obviously, it never does.    And while these people are behind bars, oftentimes they attack, sometimes kill guards, attack, sometimes kill other inmates.

11530956094	100100	Congressman, this is an important question to clarify. So, in 2007, we launched the platform in order to make it so that people could sign into other apps, bring some of their information and some of their friends' information to have social experiences.    This created a lot of innovative experiences, new games, companies like Zynga. There were companies that you are familiar with like Netflix and Spotify had integrations with this that allowed social experiences in their apps. But, unfortunately, there were also a number of apps that used this for abuse, to collect people's data.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here, Mr. Zuckerberg.    Two things: First of all, I want to thank Facebook. You streamlined our congressional baseball game last year. We have got the managers here. And I was told that, because of that, we raised an additional $100,000 for DC literacy and feeding kids and stuff, so that is----    The other thing is, I usually put my stuff up on the TV. I don't want to do it very much because it is my dad, and he would be mad if he went international like you are. And he has been on Facebook for a long time. He is 88. It has been good for connecting with kids and grandkids.    I just got my mother involved on an iPad and--because she can't handle a keyboard. And so--and I did this last week. So, in the swirl of activity, I still think there is a positive benefit for my parents to be engaged on this platform.

11530956018	1100	Congressman, what we allow with our developer platform is for people to choose to sign into other apps and bring their data with them. That is something that a lot of people want to be able to do.    The reason why we built the developer platform in the first place was because we thought it would be great if more experiences that people had could be more social. So, if you could have a calendar that showed your friends' birthdays, if you could have an address book that had pictures of your friends in it, if you could have a map that showed your friends' addresses on it.    In order to do that, you need to be able to sign into an app, bring some of your data and some of your friends' data, and that is what we built. Now, since then, we have recognized that that can be used for abuse too, so we have limited it so now people can only bring their data when they go to an app.    But that is something that a lot of people do on a day-to-day basis is sign into apps and websites with Facebook, and that is something that we are going----	All right. Now, you said yesterday that each of us owns the content that we put on Facebook and that Facebook gives some control to consumers over their content, but we know about the problems with Cambridge Analytica.    I know you changed your rules in 2014 and again this week, but you still allow third parties to have access to personal data.

11525545035	1100	Certainly, Congressman, I would be happy to answer as best I can. I will admit to you that even when we were in the dairy business, I am not sure I ever understood the Marketing Orders, but I hope to understand it better, going forward.    Back to your original question about diversity of agriculture in California. I had the pleasure this past week of meeting with about 30 of your Western Growers there that comprised California, Arizona, a little bit of Nevada there.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Again, welcome, Mr. Secretary, and we look forward to working with you. And you, like myself and many of us here, reflect generations of farm families, and we obviously welcome you to this important effort as we look at reauthorizing the farm bill.    I don't want to repeat what has been discussed already; Farm Credit, crop insurance, cotton, and dairy, but I would like to focus on some California issues specifically.    As the number one agricultural state, the diversity and the breadth and the width, we take great pride in the production in California, and I know you are aware of it. My California colleagues and I here on the dais would like to invite you sooner rather than later to come out to California where we could have a conversation with our farmers, ranchers, dairymen and women, and talk about the complexity of California agriculture.    Speaking of which, we worked very hard in the last farm bill to provide the opportunity for the California dairy industry to participate in the Federal Marketing Order. We have completed the process of the due diligence. USDA is moving on this Milk Marketing Order. I would like to get your thoughts on the current timeline, and can we tackle this final rule before the end of 2017? As you know, the quota issue, if you haven't been briefed on it, is a key part of whether or not the dairy producers will provide a 2/3 vote to join the Federal Marketing Order.

11420722107	101000	Well, thank you for raising this important issue, Congressman. I think that the issue of the training that we at the Department of Justice provide for law enforcement as well as the training generated in the field is of utmost importance. And I will tell you that as I have, in fact, traveled the country on my community policing tour highlighting departments that are working on this very issue, I've seen some outstanding examples, in particular, of de-escalation training using various scenarios to start, literally, with the mindset of the officer and how they respond to certain situations.    I have also been extremely encouraged by seeing law enforcement comment on many of the recent incidents that have been captured on video and talk about how training would or would not relate to those specific incidents. And I've been incredibly heartened by the growing sense of importance this issue has taken on within law enforcement itself. We have seen a number of, as I mentioned, of very, very positive programs involving training. We have seen, as I mentioned, not just the de-escalation but also training in the issues about the definitions of excessive force, the legal standards for excessive force. I have seen programs that break that down for officers, where we have seen----	Thank you very much. Last week, we saw more disturbing videos of police shooting of African-Americans, and we saw police officers killed in Dallas. And that was dreadful. The other side has made a point, my friends, to say people should know that nobody is above the law and all people are treated equally. Unfortunately, what we have seen is that African-Americans are not treated equally when it comes to deadly force and police officers in this country. And that's a more chilling reality than anything else that's been brought up here today. People's lives have been taken. This is a great problem. Black lives matter.    Congressman Lacy Clay and I put forward a bill last year, the Police Training and Independent Review Act, H.R. 2302, to address two of the major issues that have been identified as necessary to help improve the relationship of police and citizens. The bill would withhold a portion of Federal funding unless police are trained on a range of important issues like racial and ethnic bias and cultural diversity. I know the DOJ recently announced it would train all its office agents to recognize implicit bias, so I know you are aware of the need of training.    Our bill would also withhold a portion of Federal funding, unless police shootings that result in a death or injury are investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted independently. Asking a local prosecutor to investigate the same law enforcement agency they work with and provide them with witnesses is implicitly wrong. Like Caesar's wife, an individual should be a prosecutor beyond the appearance of impropriety. If a prosecutor does everything right, the action can still appear biased.    If we are serious about restoring the sense of trust that we need to have with our citizenry, we need to eliminate this conflict of interest. As I know, as you've mentioned, a key part of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing calls for independent prosecutors. Campaign Zero, gaining a lot of credibility, also has called for the passage of this act. Congressman Clay and I have seen a surge of support. We now have 77 cosponsors. It has been endorsed by an unlikely a team maybe as the NAACP and the Chicago Tribune.

11531349031	100100	Flattening of yield curves in the past has been a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold inflation down.    That is not the situation we have now. It is very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up, as the economy strengthens. I don't see a particularly large--there is always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.	If I could point out a possible risk that is out there and have you react to it that was created by the unconventional monetary policy. Some have blamed the Fed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by producing an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates exceeded long-term rates.    At the beginning of 2011, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was almost 3 percent. But as of February of this year, that same spread has been whittled down to a mere 0.5 percent, and this is a 450 percent drop. Given a flattening yield curve, and economic conditions that you can see, call for raising the Fed funds rate, how will the Fed avoid another inverted yield curve?    Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer-term assets more quickly to counteract that flattening yield curve?

11635589098	1001	I will have to look into it.	Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.

11420722045	101000	Congressman, I think the issue, as is usual, doesn't really lend itself well to aphorisms and short statements. And it's my hope that the work of many on this Committee and, indeed, throughout Congress in having the discussion that has begun on this issue will continue so that we can, in fact, continue to work on the serious issues of access to firearms in our society.    Earlier this year, I did make several recommendations to the White House, which were accepted, for important ways for dealing with this issue, ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers, ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities, such as trusts.    But also, as part of that, a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the information and the issues arising out of gun violence, as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy.

11635589064	1100	So, I think it is important to consider all of these things in the context of the challenges from China. You have seen what we have done with respect to Taiwan. It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, as you know, last Congress I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act, and President Trump signed it into law last March. The intention of this legislation was to allow our high-level officials to go to Taipei and to allow their high-level officials to come here to the United States, including Washington. In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations? And can the people of Taiwan count on you to advocate for further implementation of that I think very important legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act?

11635589125	101000	Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.    As for what is going to be shared and released on conversations between the President and his foreign partners, the White House ultimately makes those decisions. And so, the inquiries would properly be lodged there.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being with us. Thank you for your service.    March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?

11532380042	101000	Well, we can. And the constitutional rights of Americans should be protected. And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.    I know the committee has decided to put some additional restrictions on the way the act is conducted. We did not think that was lawfully required. Congress can make its own decisions, and we will continue to be able to share our thoughts about how the legislation should be crafted.	Thank you very much.    Welcome, Mr. Attorney General.    We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise? Can't we allow the intelligence community to stop terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans?

11497630029	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    With respect to the Department's enforcement of our various civil rights statutes, it is certainly robust and will continue to be so. While we no longer have the advantage of the preclearance provisions that were in the Voting Rights Act, we still have significant provisions of the Voting Rights Act that allow us to review actions and decisions taken, albeit after the fact, to determine whether there has been either a discriminatory intent or, as is very often the case, a discriminatory result.    We can engage in negotiation and conversations. Many times, we do that before we even move to litigation in an attempt to reason with or have a discussion with entities that are making significant changes. And often those discussions are very productive. I was pleased to see that, after discussions with Members of Congress, the State of Alabama may be making some modifications to those changes. And, certainly, those types of discussions are an efficient way to bring about change and raise these important issues.    But I will reiterate, Congressman, that the Department of Justice is committed to enforcing the civil rights laws that we do have on the books. And we are committed to a vigorous review of matters that are brought to our attention and will ensure full and fair and efficient review of those matters and take the action that is appropriate.	Thank you.    The State of Alabama's plan to close 31 driver's license offices demonstrates how one policy decision can have wide-ranging discriminatory effects. The media's picked up on this. And this will make it harder for citizens of these rural counties to vote.    And I'm just as concerned about the discriminatory economic effects of this decision, which will fall hardest on rural, poor, and African-American communities. I imagine a Black farmer driving hundreds of miles across rural Alabama to renew an expired driver's license. And, on this Committee, we know what might happen to such a young man.

11525545136	101000	Certainly, our vegetable and our produce section of agriculture, and your people in south Florida and the growers in Florida have maybe been the ones that have not benefitted as much from NAFTA as the rice or the grain, the grain producers, or even dairy in that way. It is a real challenge, but most of the challenge comes from the countercyclical culture of growth. I mean they are lower in the hemisphere than we are, and can grow things different seasonally in that way. But we have to make sure that the safety of those products is just what we insist on in our American producers as well.    And as regarding NAFTA negotiations, my hope and my advocacy will be that we don't go backward in that. But you see, that is one of the areas where we probably can improve our position vis-a-vis Mexico, with regarding fruits and vegetables.

I visited with your Chairman and Ranking Member here, the Chairman and Ranking Member of Ag Appropriations to let them know of my plans and to do that. I may not be as attuned to the Federal requirements of permission as they are, but all I know is my heartbeat is to make good and to do well, and to make sure USDA continues to serve the best way. I can't answer the specific process question that you asked.	Yes, we have the legislation, it is just a matter of authorizing the expenditure on that. And I would like to offer an invitation to you to come see the locks and dam system along the Mississippi River. That is the entire western border of my district is the Mississippi, and seeing the locks and dams that were built in the 1930s that really need a lot of attention. But we would love to have you come and visit us, so consider that an invitation.    Quickly shifting gears, yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released a report outlining many of the economic challenges in rural America, which I would like to have entered into the record. But I would also like to acknowledge something that Congresswoman Fudge said earlier, that I am concerned about the Trump Administration budget that calls for a 21 percent cut in USDA, including eliminating Rural Development's water infrastructure programs, and the Rural Business--Cooperative Service. Just a big concern. And that can be echoed, you will probably hear some other questions from my colleagues here. But the reorganization also eliminates the Rural Development mission area entirely, as well as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary, which you have addressed for a moment. But it is my understanding that you have already submitted the reorganization plan to Congress for the mandatory 30 day notification period, however, just today, you sought public comment through a Federal Register notice on the proposal.

Thank you, Mr. Powell, for being here, welcome.    Some of my colleagues have talked about how we are, where we are. The economy is--clearly seems to be getting better. We all agree with that. We will disagree on why and how. I personally think that a lot of the good we are seeing today is the result of the actions we took several years ago to stabilize, secure, and improve the economy and is now working its way through the system. But I will leave that debate for another day.    I also want to associate myself with the comments made by Mr. Meeks. I would encourage you as well to keep a close eye on the CRA.    I also want to take that and I will expand it a little bit, just a little bit more.

Beautiful horses, beautiful animals, but we have to balance that with our humane treatment. That is what APHIS does. For the reputation of the wonderful people in the Walking Horse industry, they want the bad actors out as much as anyone does. That is what we hope to have as a regulatory protocol that will ensure how the enforcement operates in that, how that is done, best assures the public that these animals are not being treated inhumanely in order for them to perform. I welcome that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Secretary Perdue. Your presence is greatly appreciated here this morning.    I represent Tennessee's Fourth Congressional District.

11497630000	101000	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    With respect to that important issue, as I've indicated, the most important priority of the Department of Justice is the protection of the American people. And, certainly, national security and terrorism are one of my own top priorities and certainly an area of concern for all of us. That is certainly our main concern.    At the same time, we do have a system for allowing not just immigration but refugee entrance into the country. As the FBI Director has noted, there is a process in place that allows for significant vetting of refugees from all countries.	Thank you, General Lynch.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.

With respect to the argument that was made on the issue, of course I'd have to review those pleadings to understand the specific context and whether or not there was an appropriations issue involved as to whether----	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Attorney General. It's a pleasure to have you here, and I look forward to working with you, not only today, but in the months ahead.    As you likely know, I am on the Immigration Subcommittee and I follow closely what your Department is doing in that arena. Your predecessor, Attorney General Holder, testified in 2013 before the Senate, and this is a direct quote: ``It is inexcusable that young kids, 6, 7 year olds, 14 year olds, have immigration decisions made on their behalf against them and they're not represented by counsel.''    Now, in July of this year, the American Immigration Council and several other organizations filed a class action lawsuit in District Court in the Western District of Washington challenging the validity of removal proceedings for children without appointed counsel. And their argument was that an 8-year-old couldn't receive a full and fair hearing in the immigration court without representation.    As you know, I'm sure, the Administration has made efforts to provide counsel to small children by funding nonprofit groups, but the Assistant Attorney General who argued, I think a Mr. Leon Fresco, actually argued contrary to that in the District Court. And I'm wondering if the Department's position has changed since Mr. Holder left the Department and whether you think it could meet due process to have an 8-year-old who speaks only Spanish appear in immigration court without a lawyer and be able to argue the nuances of immigration law and asylum law.

11420722054	1100	Congressman, with respect to the Director's statements, as I've indicated, he's provided really unprecedented access into his views of the matter, and I would refer you to them.    I understand the issue that you raise, obviously, is one involving perceptions as to whether or not charges would have been brought in some other situation. And, again, I can only refer you back to the Director's statements, where he chose to outline the fact that no other cases similar to this had, in fact, been brought.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Madam Attorney General, I think the thing that I find so disheartening, so unfortunate, about FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week was that, for a lot of Americans, it looked like we're seeing a double standard, unequal treatment under the law.    Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.    Now, I assume that, based upon the way you've answered some of my colleague's questions prior to this, you're not going to acknowledge what I think virtually every other American believes, even her supporters, and that's to at least acknowledge, as Director Comey did, that she lied.

Mr. Perdue, certainly, as another fellow veterinarian, as Mr. Yoho said, we are glad to have you, as a fellow farmer we are glad to have you, and I am sure General Bacon, who is sitting right in front of me, as an Air Force veteran, is glad that he has a fellow Air Force veteran sitting in your chair. We are so happy.    We certainly look for a close relationship. And for a man that, as Governor, stood on the Capitol steps during a severe drought and prayed for rain, and then shortly thereafter addressed record flooding, I definitely want to be closer to you if things go south.    So you have answered certainly most of my questions. The Chairman had one on the cottonseed issue, and that is very near and dear to me in Louisiana. The Ranking Member brought up the State Director of Rural Development and FSA, when they would be filled. And then Mr. Crawford brought up the practical to replant issue, which hit us right between the eyes in Louisiana with the flooding last year. I appreciate you addressing all those issues.    The quick question I do want to ask is that, with furrow irrigation rice, your agency has allowed that to become an insured crop, and in Louisiana we certainly appreciate that. As you know, with the furrow irrigated rice they tend to use the blast resistant seed. And for those here that don't know what that is, it is a fungus that affects rice and just devastates yields. And if they use that seed; that blast resistant seed, production goes up, yield per acre, and certainly water usage goes down, so it is a great thing.

11531349059	1100	Thank you. Of course when we are setting monetary policy we are focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment. In doing that, we consider many, many factors all around, the global economy, et cetera.    Fiscal policy changes can have an effect, and changes of this size can have an effect. That can be seen, of course, in the path to policy. It is very hard to say in advance what that would be, but the answer to your question is generally we take all those things into account.	Chairman Powell, welcome. As the Chair of our committee points out, you are required to be independent and accountable. You are also required to be tall and short.    Your opening statement mentions great exports. But you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by $60 billion in the last year. I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit. That is why the country elected Donald Trump President.    Now, the Chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017. He is right. We had Obama's fiscal policies, Obama's tax policies, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, Janet Yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet, and we had a great year.    As a matter of fact, we have been on a roll since 2011. We were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we would have a labor shortage and higher wages. We were going well, and so instead of continuing to be on a roll, we have abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy, throwing away the budget caps, $1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill.    But I think that we will still do well because our scientists, our entrepreneurs, and our workers are the best in the world, and they will make up for all the mistakes we are making here in Washington.    I see behind you, sir, the green shirts that call for full employment. It is not enough to go with the economists' definition of full employment, say 4 percent. We need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor.    That is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for 2 percent, but 2-1/2 percent inflation. That is the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now.    Now, when we talk about some workers getting a $1,000 bonus, yes, a few have, but a family of five's share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000. What greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country than that some charlatan can say, ``Here is the deal. I will give you $1,000. It is money in your pocket, and we will just slap a $26,000 mortgage on your future.''    Now, Chairman Powell, in your confirmation hearings, you said that, I believe, that no bank is any longer too big to fail. I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail; they would pull the entire economy down. We had to bail them out with $700 billion.    I would point out that the Wall Street prices into the value of the banks' stock, but more importantly, to the value of their unsecured debt, an implicit Federal guarantee, an assumption that they will be bailed out.    I have a number of questions for the record, but I will actually ask one for you to respond to. We have adopted these profligate fiscal policies.

11531349044	101000	I do think our post-crisis policies were effective. I haven't carefully studied that report yet, but let me say that what these reports try to do is they try to identify the surprise element in a particular Fed announcement and isolate that from what was already priced into the market.    Most things that happen on announcement day are already priced in. It is very hard to isolate that surprise element. This paper takes a different way of doing that, and it comes up with the answer that comes in.    Overwhelmingly, studies of the effects of asset purchase programs suggest that asset purchase programs did their job, which was to create downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through the term premium. I would say that that is very likely the case.	Last, Chairman Powell, last week, several academics published a paper claiming that the Fed's quantitative easing programs during the Great Recession were largely ineffective at stimulating the economy. New York Fed President Dudley and Boston Fed President Rosengren disagreed and said that they thought that quantitative easing had been effective.

I thought that was the way the system should work. There was very timely action toward depopulation and eliminating the potential spread of that disease, and it has been long enough now that if that had not been effective, we would have seen that. I think the system is working. We learned a lot from 2015, and your State of Alabama and the State of Georgia all collaborated very, very well to make sure that the High-Path AI was contained.

11525545197	101000	Certainly. I smile because with your Western Growers the other day, we were talking about produce and melons and those kind of things, and we were talking about this very issue. And I said, well, when I grew up, we were a diversified row crop farm, but he loved truck farming, he loved melons, watermelons, cantaloupes, beans, and sweet corn, but I was his labor right there handling those watermelons, so I know what it takes to harvest them, and I know that it is very, very difficult to get domestic labor to do that any longer. And it is not really a matter of taking American jobs at any cost. We had a situation in Georgia where the legislature felt like they needed to have a tough immigration bill, and it really flushed out a lot of the harvest labor that we had there in Georgia. And there was an example where the Governor said we will let probationers do this, and so they did that for a day or so, but after about half a day the guys said can we go back to prison, because they just weren't willing to do that work. We understand it.    The good news is the President understands as well. This roundtable that we had, I think he understands the contribution that immigrant labor has made to our fields and farms, in processing and other things. We know from poultry processing and other things, there is a lot of immigrant labor.    When I said a way forward, I don't know that I can elaborate on the path today, but I have specifically hired a young woman who is a lawyer from Nebraska, who worked with Farm Bureau, whose expertise is in the farm labor. And what we want to do is to give to my boss in the Administration an opportunity and to thread the needle over this issue of how we utilize immigrant labor in this nation.    I believe the heart is there, the how-to and the process right now is what we have to figure out, but I can tell you, trade, labor, regulations are job one, two, and three.	Once again, my name is Jimmy Panetta. I represent the Central Coast of California; what my colleagues know as, based on my advertising, and I will tell you, the salad bowl of the world. We have plenty of specialty crops in that area. And this point I will be so brash as to personally invite you out to the Central Coast of California so that you can reinforce your understanding of specialty crops, and also what it takes to harvest these specialty crops. And what I mean by that, and what you know and what you have heard, is labor, and that has been an issue. Obviously, California, like Georgia, experienced some droughts, especially one in the past few years, excluding this year, thankfully. But even during that drought, the number one issue for our people in agriculture, especially on the Central Coast, was immigration, was labor force. And now, based on the political atmosphere in this country, based on the changing socioeconomic atmosphere in Mexico and southern Central America, and based on Congress' failure to do anything on immigration since 1986, it is not just an issue, it is an emergency. And I tell you, every single person that I speak to in agriculture, farmer to farmworker, they will tell you that the lack of labor force is the number one most pressing issue that they are facing right now, and it is an emergency situation.    I appreciate your statement during confirmation to Senator Gillibrand when she asked if you had a commitment to making sure that producers have access to farmworkers, and your response was, ``I will commit that to you, Senator.'' And then right away today, to Representative Costa, you said, ``I will help to provide a way forward when it comes to immigration and making sure that there is labor there to help us harvest our crops.''

11389598095	110000	No. I have done no investigations. I have read the IG's report that said inappropriate criteria were used to identify organizations for review. And the IG had nine recommendations, and we have accepted all of those recommendations.    I think it's important for the public to be confident that, whoever they are, they're going to be treated fairly by the IRS, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, belong to organizations of one kind or another. Wherever they show up, wherever they speak, they should understand they'll be treated fairly. If there's an issue, it's because something in their tax return; if somebody else had that issue, they would get the same response from the IRS.    I think it's critical that the public have that confidence, and we're doing everything we can to restore that confidence.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like Mr. Mica, John Koskinen, I have known you well before you came to Congress. Since coming to Congress, I have been impressed, not a little bit, by the confidence you have inspired in Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. It's as if they saved you for jobs that others couldn't do, didn't have the guts to do, or didn't have the integrity to do. You are well-known on both sides of the aisle as the government's most versatile turnaround artist. When an agency is in trouble, turn to John Koskinen.    Therefore, I begin my series of questions simply by offering you an apology. I believe you deserve one. You deserve one because of accusations designed to sacrifice the reputation of a public servant with a spotless reputation, for political advantage, without a scintilla--and I use my words advisedly--of evidence.    It's vile enough to look a man in the face and accuse him of perjury without submitting any evidence. It is much worse when all of the evidence supports the version of the facts of the man you are facing. Whether it is that the Lerner crash occurred well before this investigation began--she must be clairvoyant; whether it's been confirmed by the decriminalization lab, all the evidence is on your side, Mr. Koskinen.    And I want to point out for the record that the line of conspiracy hunting has shifted with the Lerner crash. For the longest time, the line of questioning was about one subject alone. So we've moved from one scapegoat to another. What we've just moved off of, the notion that this was all a conspiracy directed on behalf of the White House, that also without a crumb of evidence. Lacking evidence, the crash provides new fodder.

11525545019	1100	Congressman Scott, you have identified some real challenges. You talked about the age issue, but those are particularly significant and disadvantage to opportunities as well.	 Thank you very much.    Mr. Secretary, all of Georgia is very proud of you, and this nation will soon find out why. You are a wonderful, wonderful person, and we are delighted to have you as our Secretary of Agriculture.    Mr. Secretary, we are faced with a very serious national crisis, and that national crisis is the expanding age of our farmers. The average age of our farmers is right at 60 years of age. And we in this Committee have put together a bill to address that. It is House Resolution 51. Let me just tell you, we have been on this mission for over 2 years. It gives us an opportunity to utilize the 19 1890s African American land-grant institutions, which you are familiar with. Fort Valley is a case in Georgia. And you know the whole history of that. We were able to make sure that we had these land-grants.    You have the University of Florida, you have Florida A&M, and Prairie View in Texas, and so forth. The Presidents of these universities have come before this Committee and addressed this need. We have this bill. It is House Resolution 51. What it does is this. It will allow us to utilize these 19 1890s to address this issue and get our younger generation into farming, into agriculture. And more than that, agriculture is new farming, it is far beyond the mule and the plough from past; agriculture is a very sophisticated, technology-driven, science-driven engineering. These African American institutions have curricula applied to address what we refer to as STEM; science, technology, education, and math, at these.    What we want to do with this bill is to change some language in the farm bill which would, one, right now these universities can only spend the money we give them in education, research, and extension. But we want to change and add a fourth area that they could spend it in, which would be student scholarships. We have also set aside and we are working with the CCC, which is the Commodities Credit Corporation, to make sure we have the sufficient funds available. We are offering $1 million for each of the 5 years, for each of the 19 schools. That comes to $95 million. It is something that these universities who have been there in the fire, and have helped to find young people a way out of no options. And we have not exactly been efficient in applying funding, but this would be the area to do it.    I want you to know that this is a bipartisan bill. We have Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, as the sponsor on the Republican side, myself, several on this Committee; Ms. Fudge, Mr. Lawson, Ms. Adams, another Republican, Mrs. Mia Love out of Utah.    So what I want to ask of you, and I know you have been on 4 weeks, we want to make sure, we sent the bill to your staff, and certainly we want you to really get familiar with it and help us get this bill through our Committee here where it is now, onto the floor and to the Senate, and to the White House. We have been in touch with the White House. We are working with the Senior Legislative Director there, Marc Short. Marc is very familiar with it, and our Blue Dog Democratic meeting he and I talked about it. And President Trump is interested in this type of effort. And, of course, when you read it, if they haven't already informed you, the administration of this particular bill will be through the Department of Agriculture.    So we appreciate you. We can't get it done without your help here. And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?

11525545065	101000	I would be happy to, friend. First of all, let me talk about research just a second because you mentioned that. And you are absolutely right, the reason our producers are so productive today in the 21st century is because of the research and the foundation that has been laid. It is not something that can be cut off and on. And the other thing is the delivery system of that basic and applied research to the field through the extension service has been the wonder of the world, and we see what difference it has made in our productivity, and will continue to need to be as we have to feed nine billion people by 2050.    That is important, but you made a great point, another thing that is just as important is the technology, because you know your producers in middle and south Georgia are using technology for better water usage, better technology for precision agriculture, for monitoring crop needs; whether it is whatever adding, and the telemetry that is needed out there is dependent on wireless technology and WiFi. The other thing sociologically, Congressman, in today's world of connectivity, it might be true in your house with Wells' age, if the water goes off that is kind of a disadvantage, if your lights go off, oh, bummer, if your heat goes off you will get a blanket, but if your WiFi goes off that is a crisis. And that is kind of what happens out there in the world today is we are not sociologically, to Congressman Scott's point, we are not going to keep these young people on the farm attracted there if they don't have the connectivity they are used to when they go to college. They are not going to come back. And it is vitally important. The good news is this is square on the radar scope of the President, as well as the FCC Chairman. I have had conversations with him. He is anxiously awaiting the infrastructure plan where we can ambitiously take rural broadband ubiquitously across the country. As you know, there are places in our home state you can't even get a cell signal.    We have a lot of challenges, but I am convinced of what you hit on, it is the modern-day road, sewer, water of the 21st century is connectivity. And I look forward to promulgating as much of that as we can across the country.	Yes. I am not sure if you would be mending fence or checking cows right now if she hadn't agreed to marry you. You probably wouldn't be here.    Great man, great family, and what you will find from Sonny Perdue is, if he can help you, he will help you, and if he tells you he is going to do something, he is going to do it, and I have always appreciated that from you.    And, Governor, just a couple of quick comments and questions maybe. I was at the USDA research station in Byron this last week. As you know, research is not something that you can simply cut on and off; it is a long-term commitment, it is a long-term investment, and that investment has to be coupled with extension for it to actually get to the fields and help the farmers and our economy. And so they brought up while I was there the hiring freeze, and certainly hope that as we go forward we are able to come out from underneath that hiring freeze, and that you have the flexibility to put the people in the most effective areas with regard to research, and that that partnership will be there with the states, I know under you for the extension to actually get that research to the field.    Your commitment to 4-H, your commitment to FFA is something that also those two organizations are extremely important to rural America, and I know that those organizations will benefit from you being in that position as well.    One of the things that has changed on the farm in the last couple of years, and is changing at an exponential rate, is the use of technology. We know that President Trump will have an infrastructure program that will be put forward. The rural broadband, as you know, we need that, quite honestly, more than we need roads and bridges in many of the counties that I represent. You know from growing up in Houston County, you have metropolitan areas and then just a few miles down the road you have areas like you grew up in, in Bonaire, and I lived in Ashburn for a long time. I tell people I live in Tifton now but I actually live in Chula, Georgia. And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package?

11530242059	110000	Congresswoman, I understand your point, and it is my understanding we were in compliance with the safeguards rule and that the safeguards rule does not prevent 100 percent against data breaches.	Thank you.    Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.    So in my mind, this is the most open and shut violation of the safeguards rule that I have ever seen in the history of this country. So my question to you, Mr. Smith, is, do you believe that Equifax violated the FTC's safeguard rule?

11497630042	101000	Thank you, Congressman.    We fully support the Judicial Redress Act. And I actually would like to thank you and the other Members of this Committee for the important work that you've done on this issue.    As you have noted, this legislation is critical to continued law enforcement sharing of information from the U.S. and the European Union. In fact, I have been involved in discussions with ministers from the European Union on the Data Protection Act, often called the Umbrella Act, as well as the Judicial Redress Act.    It certainly is our view that this important legislation should be passed. It would provide, as you know, redress for European Union citizens should there be an unauthorized or misuse of their data here in the U.S., which is a privilege enjoyed by U.S. citizens within the European Union.    Without this, we do have a grave risk of not having the completion of the data protection or umbrella agreement. And I think, sadly, recent events have shown us the importance, the critical nature, of making sure that we have these safe and secure portals for transferring information from one law enforcement entity to another.	Okay.    Let me ask one question on an unrelated matter. As you may know, the House, last month, passed a bill called the Judicial Redress Act, which, in my opinion, is essential to enforcing an umbrella agreement to transfer law enforcement information from certain European countries to the United States and vice versa.

We have not made a decision in the longer run whether that will continue to be our framework or whether we will return to something more like what we did before the crisis.    I don't have a schedule for--I don't expect to be returning to that decision in the near term. I would just say that our current approach seems to be working very well. It gives us control over rates, and the market seems to understand it.	Thank you, Chairman Powell.    The Chair now yields to himself for 5 minutes.

11525545059	110000	Okay. Those are three important issues, and I would be happy to address all of them, if you don't mind. Again, from an RD perspective, I welcome the accountability. I am an outcome kind of guy. As I understand the current organizational chart, the Under Secretaries report to the Deputy Secretary, and I view the RD portion of this, particularly in limited resources, possibly with an infrastructure program from the Administration and you all. I am not a micromanager but I am a hands-on manager, and this is an area that Secretary Vilsack and I had wonderful conversations about how the potential of USDA has been used across the country in rural communities, both in water systems, both in utilities, and both in community facilities. This is something I guess I jealously wanted to be a part of. When I say elevated, I mean elevated to a portion where that person is going to be sitting close to me, with walk-in privileges over, this is a great opportunity, this is the deal, what do you think about, how can we do better to do that.    I welcome your oversight in the RD portion. The mission is not going to diminish whatsoever. The distribution network that has been developed out here with great people all over the country is not going to be diminished at all. The people in RD are going to report to this Assistant Secretary, who will have direct access to the Secretary, and I consider that an elevation. You can think about it as a nomenclature, but there was in no way a diminishment. If you gave me the opportunity in a corporation to have direct access to the CEO on walk-in privileges over ideas versus a title of a VP, give me that direct access anytime. That is the influence, that is the power, the access. That is the way I view the RD, and I look forward to your accountability in that.    NRCS' mission is not going to change, people aren't going to change. Maybe some locations might change from an economy of scale perspective, as I explained earlier. If we have disparate people and maybe two per office in different places, and we can combine there to have an economy of scale that makes a difference of service to our customers, we may consider doing that. In fact, there are actually preclusions about closing any places. If there is any combination of bringing the family into one house rather than being scattered out in a compound, then we look to have better service in that way.    Third, the advocacy and Secretary Vilsack had made a lot of progress in that. I don't see that diminishing whatsoever.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Secretary, it was really good to hear you talk about feeding the world. That is very different from the President's budget which has cut almost every single feeding program, or zeroed them out. I am hopeful that you will win.    I am as well concerned, as my Ranking Member, about Rural Development. It is indicated in the reorganization plan that there would no longer be an Under Secretary; it was going to be elevated in some way. I am not sure how that is, except because the Under Secretary reports to you now, so I am not sure what that change is really going to be. But I am concerned, and certainly we will see how it goes as we move forward because, I tell you, you have been really busy in 4 short weeks. This is a major reorganization. I am just going to be watching, as is the rest of the Committee, to see how we progress with that.    Mr. Lucas raised the issue of NRCS, which I am also concerned about. And my first question to you is should we, in the future, look forward to seeing any kind of mergers within the agency or plans to close any of our NRCS offices? And my second question relates to the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, which Congress put in place so that there would be an advocate on behalf of small, beginning, and minority farmers. Last year, the USDA elevated that office to report directly to the Secretary, to you, sir. Your proposed plan now drops it back down to reporting to the Assistant Secretary for Departmental Administration. I just want to know what your thinking was on that?

So when you hear me say that we are going to do things differently, I don't want to automatically imply that the staff was not doing a good job before I got there. In fact, my experience has been that nothing could be further from the truth. I have been very impressed with the quality of the work that the staff has been asked to do.    The question is what have they been asked to do by their leadership. And one of the things I have asked the staff to pay closer attention to, moving forward, is the cost benefit analysis. I was, quite frankly, surprised, Mr. Luetkemeyer, by the amount of qualitative cost benefit analysis that was done. In fact, my background is in numbers, economics, commerce, finance. I didn't realize you could do qualitative cost benefit analysis. I thought cost benefit analysis was supposed to be quantitative.    I have come to accept, I think, that a certain amount of qualitative analysis is part--can be a valuable part of any analysis. But we are going to do a better job on quantitative analysis.    So, to your point, we are going to take a close look at how consumers would be affected, in terms of services that would not be available to them, the impact on the markets, the impacts on availability of credit, the impacts of availability of capital, and the flow of capital to small businesses and to individuals. We are going to do more quantitative analysis in those areas.

Well, I think we should, and I think, Mr. Chairman, we should make that request formal in terms of our committee, if not for the whole membership of the House.    Yesterday, I had a hearing here in our Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia. And as part of that hearing, we dealt with the historic 70-year alliance that we had with Europe, one of the most successful alliances in modern history, if not the history of Europe itself.    And one of the things that came across to me in a recent trip there about three and a half weeks ago was the concern with the officials there. Let me give you one example that really was difficult for me to address when I was asked. The EU officials that we met with, they used words like ``painful'' and ``hurtful,'' and they meant it sincerely, when they were talking about how they felt from actions of the United States.    And one thing they said, in particular, was that the emergency security powers that we used to assess the tariffs that were there struck them, because they asked the question, ``You are using emergency security powers to create tariffs on our closest allies.'' And they were asking us--and maybe you could help us with this--when did they become a security risk to the United States?

Before I raise some particular questions with you, you have made quite--made it quite known this morning that you don't have to be here and that you don't have to answer questions. I don't know why you think that is so extraordinary. The previous director came here 63 times and not only answered all of our questions, but was badgered by our Chairman. So we certainly expect you to be here, and we certainly expect you to answer our questions.

11635589087	101000	It is something that previous Administrations and this Administration continue to review. We have to place it in the context of our larger policy, Indo-Pacific policy, even more broadly. We are trying to make sure that we get each of these steps right.    What President Trump has directed each of us to do is recognize facts on the ground, try to apply good common sense, and then, generate policies that actually get outcomes. I think for an awful long time, we have done things that made us feel good, but did not deliver. And so, with respect to this particular issue, and all the issues that surround it in Asia, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people. And so, as we consider the appropriateness of a lot of decisions on designations, on sanctions, on how the Department of Defense is going to posture, how we work with Southeastern countries, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people.

11497630098	110000	I have not reviewed that specific IG's report. What I can tell you is that the prosecution and apprehension of individuals at the border is one to which not just the Department, but the specific U.S. attorneys in those border States devote significant time and attention. And steps are taken at the initial level to try and ensure that those who are seeking asylum are handled appropriately and that those who are coming in for other intents and purposes are handled through the immigration law system and often the criminal law system.	Let me ask you this. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General has done an analysis of--we have many people from Central America in particular who are seeking asylum. And what he reports, that there is a review called Operation Streamline that found that the Department of Justice has actually prosecuted asylum seekers for illegal entry before their asylum case is heard.    And it seems to me that while not only does that violate the requirements of international law, but it doesn't seem like an efficient use of resources. If someone gains asylum under the law, then their prosecution would not be very pertinent. And I'm wondering, have you reviewed that IG's report yet?

11530956129	11000	Congressman, I think you are raising an important point, which is that I think if someone wanted to know, they could. But I think that a lot of people probably just accept terms of service without taking the time to read through it.    I view our responsibility not as just legally complying with laying it out and getting that consent but actually trying to make sure that people understand what is happening throughout the product.    That is why every single time that you share something on Facebook or one of our services, right there is a control in line where you control who you want to share with. Because I don't just think that this is about a terms of service. It is contextual. You want to present people with the information about what they might be doing and give them the relevant controls in line at the time that they are making those decisions, not just have it be in the background sometime or upfront make a one-time decision.

The witness answers the question and adds details. He adds these details to support his answer. I believe he is trying to convince the senator that he is above what she may have heard in an investigative report. Continuing with the confrontational tone, Waters asks what witness is going to do to ""ensure"" elimination of discriminatory practices in lending. The witness does not challenge the question, which in context with other questions asked has an undertone that suggests witness has eroded capabilities and lost priority in this area, but rather brilliantly states they will continue to do what they have always been doing (even during the time of the Obama administration when the congresswoman supported the action of the agency). Witness explains how they ensure lending discrimination is not prevalent."	3
11525545139	1101	Well, you mentioned several things. Let me think of that and then I can address your final question. But certainly, from the vigilance over foot-and-mouth, as well as any other disease, Congressman, you know that we thought we were done with screwworms, and yet we have these things break out, and very quickly contained, but you have to be vigilant every day.	Secretary Perdue, thanks for being here. I feel a kindred spirit being a fellow veterinarian. And I don't know whether to call you Doc, Governor, or Secretary. If you are like me, you probably prefer Doc. And I look forward to helping you achieve your mission.    The way you opened up, and everything you have said I am in alignment. And it just sounds like you have common sense. I can only feel that comes from working on the south end of a horse or a cow in your past. But what you were talking about, I look forward to helping you achieve your goal of making a realignment of the USDA to make it the most efficient agency in government. And that is such a critical thing, knowing the debt that our country is facing, we have to do more with less, and I look forward to working with you on that.    And you also talked about the USDA stamp, it should be revered and trusted, and I agree, because that stamp around the world stands for the highest quality product that you can get, and it is so important that we protect it.    And several of the things I wanted to talk about were already talked about. Your understanding of FMD, it is music to my ears. There was a point up here where it wasn't talked about much, and we know the threat. We haven't had that here since 1929. If it comes here, it would be devastating. And certainly, we know what happened with BSE with the three cases that were here, and how long it is just now taking us to recover after 15 years. And that was with no depopulation of any of the herds. And certainly, if we had an FMD outbreak, it would be devastating. It would take years and years to recover, not just our cattle herd but our trade.    And as we look forward, I look forward to working with you on the new farm bill to make continued improvements in the cotton program, as was talked, but not at the expense of other crops, i.e., peanuts. I come from north central Florida, and the cottonseed program is something we talked about, to help give diversification to the cotton growers. And that is something that I hope you would consider looking at. But what we know is with these programs, you can't have one at the expense of the other one. And with peanuts, we certainly know within that one program you have discrepancy because you have the people that have generic and/or base acres, and then you have people that have neither, and they are growing peanuts right next to each other. One is at a disadvantage because they don't fall into a program. And we have seen people switch from cotton to grow peanuts because of the farm program. And there are some things that can be fixed in that, and I hope you will look at that. And not to penalize anybody, just to give that, I guess, parity on one peanut field to the next so that those farmers can stay in business, especially the young farmers that we see.    We have several things that we have put together. What I would like to do is having a meeting with you and maybe your staff, and go over some of the things.    And then coming from Florida, we have over 360 specialty crops in Florida. Florida is known for number one in the nation for melons, sweet corn, and citrus. Even with citrus greening, as Mr. Soto brought up, we went from 470 million boxes, we are down to under 70 million boxes. It is something that has to be dealt with, and we look forward to the robust funding that USDA has done.    And I guess one of my asks for you is, the research and development that we are doing is so vitally important, and again, USDA has been great on this, that we take that research and development, because we know one of the cures is probably going to be a GMO tree, to have the USDA help in marketing those products. And that is something I would like to see USDA get involved now to move to where we can start marketing that stuff.    Do you have any thoughts about that?	Do you have any thoughts about that?

11532380000	110100	Mr. Chairman, as a former Federal prosecutor who emphasized gun prosecutions, I've long believed that they have a significant impact in reducing violent crime. Professors, earlier this year, have explained that they share that view based on scientific analysis. It will be a high priority of ours. You are correct that prosecutions fell.    One instance that was raised during the Texas--terrific, horrible shooting at the church there in Sutherland, Texas, was the ability of an individual to get a firearm and whether or not they filed correctly their form before you get one that--it requires questions about criminal convictions and court marshals.    Those prosecutions, I've noticed, have dropped by over 50 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. I think those are worthy prosecutions. And when a criminal is carrying a gun during a criminal act of some other kind, that is a clear and present danger to the public. And those cases are important, and the impact: reduction of crime.	Well, thank you, General Sessions.    We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions, and I will begin by recognizing myself.    Under your leadership, the prosecution of firearms offenses have increased 23 percent over the same period of the previous year. Furthermore, the number of defendants charged with using a firearm in violent crimes of drug trafficking rose 10 percent over the previous year.

Attorney General Lynch believes that all members of the team were career individuals and no political appointees. The witness finally answers a question."	3

11497630012	111000	Well, Congressman, with respect to the types of cases that are prosecuted, as I indicated, a lot of the firearms prosecutions are done in conjunction with our violent crime program, and they may not show up in your statistics as the lead charges. They are a significant part of the arsenal that every Federal prosecutor utilizes.    Most recently, I've convened a summit with the top elected officials, police chiefs, and leaders of major cities to talk about violent crime that's currently taking place in several major cities, with a focus on finding the causes and finding the best ways to direct Federal resources to those particular cities.	Then why aren't they being prosecuted for those violations related to firearms?    And, by the way, this doesn't just mean using a firearm in the commission of crime. It also means illegal sales of firearms. It means lying on the Instant Check System of which, for the last year for which we have complete data, 76,000 people were found to have committed the felony of swearing to false information on that form. Five thousand were referred for prosecution, but the 94 U.S. attorneys' offices across the country could only find time to prosecute 62 out of 76,000.    So somebody going into a gun store to buy a weapon knows that, even if they're caught--and often they're not caught because the system doesn't have all the information it needs in it--but even if they're caught, they often find that the odds are one in a thousand that they'll be prosecuted even when they're caught.

11420722039	111000	Congressman, every case stands on its own separate facts and application of those facts to the law. So you'd have to refer to the specific facts of the other matters that you're referring to.    With respect to the investigation into the former Secretary's handling of classified information, her private email system, again, I can tell you and this entire Committee and the American people that all of the relevant facts were considered, investigated thoroughly, and reviewed by the entire team, which, again, is composed of career independent investigators as well as lawyers. And their recommendation, upon a full and thorough analysis, was that the matter be resolved in the way in which it was recommended to me.    As I've indicated, I determined to accept that recommendation and did, in fact, accept that recommendation.	I have a limited amount of time.    You know, the fact is that, whether it's extremely careless or gross negligence and a strict liability of statute, I think that the language of the statute is clear.    Now, I've noted that the Justice Department over the last several years has prosecuted several servicemen for doing the exact same thing that Secretary Clinton did and, in one case, actually reached a judgment of a court that prohibited that serviceman from ever having a security classification again.    Now, you have a problem, Madam Attorney General, that people think that there's a different standard between the servicemen and Secretary Clinton and the fact that the language is almost synonymous, if not synonymous, saying no prosecution of Secretary Clinton and prosecution and conviction of the servicemen.    You have a burden, I think, to convince the American public that you don't have a double standard. You're not meeting the burden. And how do you plan to change the argument that you make to the American public so that they can be convinced that the thing was correct and that you made the right decision, rather than simply deferring to people in the FBI and the prosecutors?

11637282024	101100	Well, Mr. Chairman, I think from OSC's perspective, we try to apply the law as fairly as we can. To emphasize what I said in my opener, we're going to treat the well-connected the same as the little guy we are going to have one standard. We're not going to have a two-tier Hatch Act enforcement system. Obviously, cases with ordinary Federal workers go to the board, the board sometimes also imposes punishment that may differ from what we recommend.    So sometimes that's simply--imposing discipline is not something OSC does, but we are going to bring cases fairly and equally, and that's what we've done here.	I wonder if you've got, again, these 2 million Federal employees, and I'm sure these cases do come up, and where they may have one violation.

Mr. Conyers very bravely took on the Bush administration. Where relevant U.S. attorneys and case law effectively now is that in fact if a Committee of Congress wants somebody, it is not a discretion to say no. In the case of Harriet Miers, that was pretty well adjudicated, and Mr. Conyers as Chair made it very clear that Congress has a right to have someone.    Again, I'll ask you finally. Previously the reason was not that you would not make a line attorney available, but Ms. Bosserman was part of an ongoing investigation.

My comments about that is we can have some flexibility in the CRP program, maybe take out some of the least productive areas and use them rather than the whole-field type of philosophy we have had with CRP, give a little more flexibility in that way. With the wildfires we gave some flexibility regarding grazing on some of these areas as well. We want to be flexible while we maintain the integrity of the program, and help to train through FSA and NRCS our farmers to utilize their least productive acres; those that cost the most, and they may even have a better, higher net income if we don't try to plant wall-to-wall.

11635589143	111000	Yes, look, the good news is I am hopeful that Martin Griffiths, the U.N. Special Envoy in Yemen, in the next handful of days will make progress. He may not. We have a great agreement in Stockholm. We have not been able to enforce it. The Houthis have refused to withdraw from the Port of Hodeidah. I hope that they will in the coming days. Frankly, if I were betting, I would probably bet against, but one lives in hope.    Congress obviously has its own independent right to act as it so chooses. It has its constitutional authorities. I can say this: I hope everyone who cares about the people of Yemen understand that the legislation that passed did not remotely benefit them. Indeed, it will work to their detriment.

11426003075	1110	Well, thank you, Congressman.    The culture of the company is strong. And I don't--I know--	So I want you to think about that culture. Because what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina. It doesn't conform to what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis. I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina; we're grateful for it. But what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina.    I wanted to look at your code of conduct that you tout. So let's look at your code of ethics and business conduct. You said in your message as CEO, ``We are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards in how we conduct our business and serve our customers.''    The code of ethics, in fact, says, ``Our code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo and Company and its subsidiaries.'' It also says, ``We are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws.'' And, finally, ``It's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our company's code of ethics and business conduct and understanding that noncompliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.''    You clearly have failed. You've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally. You have broken, and your company has broken, longstanding law. You've broken longstanding ethical standards that you have within your company. This has nothing to do with this debate about Dodd-Frank or anything else. You've broken a longstanding law, and you've defrauded your customers.    How can you rebuild trust? And how can you get through this thing?

11531504000	111000	Well, Mr. Chairman, I think both are important, and I do think there are some regulatory options that we can pursue. Many have talked about transparency as an example with respect to the trading platform and the RFS trading platform, how long you can hold a RIN as an example, who can buy, who can sell RINs. There are those kinds of, I think, evaluations that we can engage from a regulatory perspective. And, as you know, there is also consideration about the RVP waiver and the E15 being allowed year-round.    I think that is something, it is a legal determination. It is not a policy determination. And we have been earnest the last several months evaluating that in hopes that we can get to a conclusion on our ability to take those kinds of actions. But I really believe that Congress' role in this is terribly important because as you look at the issues that we are facing with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard and the viability of the RINs platform we need both Congress and our regulatory responses to be working together.

That leaves NRE really with the responsibility of managing our U.S. Forest Service. That is where over 1/3 of the employees in USDA are, and that is, frankly, where some of the biggest challenges have come from. We face litigation, we face NEPA challenges, and other kinds of things in order to utilize the renewable resources on all of our millions of acres out here; northern California and many other states, to do that. Actually, that means jobs as well.    The good news, the fact is a healthy forest is less vulnerable to fire, and you all know that the fire budget has kind of gotten upside down in the Forest Service. We are spending more to fight fires than we are to prevent fires. We hope to get that corrected with your help and reestablished. But I believe, again, a mission area that is focused directly on utilizing the renewable aspects; whether it is deadfall going into biomass, or recovering these trees that might be down, they have a certain period of time that you can harvest them and they would be good lumber, to get ahead of that curve. The challenge is right now so much of that budget is spent in suppression rather than prevention, and we have to get ahead of that. But that is my desire.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Mr. Secretary. It is really great to have you here, and I hope things are going well for you in your transition. And it is also very heartening to hear the colleagues that you know the best; our Georgia colleagues, that have welcomed you here today, and the nonpartisan way which everybody likes working with you. That is a really good indicator compared to some of the things going on around this town.    There are so many issues here, and I am hoping, of course, that we see a rebound in ag commodities at the farm gate there, and then we can see exports are expected to come back up a little bit from a peak of just a few years ago.    We have a lot of issues going on. I have a northern California district, top of the state, and one of the things that we are very, very, concerned about is USDA's oversight of the Forest Service and the need to be much better managing our Federal lands, and moving more into biomass using this over-inventory we have of forest products, so that really need to be managed much better, as we have wildfires every year and we need to incentivize the biomass situation.    So as we work on the Federal land issue, what do you think we can do to grow the markets for biomass, have more economic activity that would be jobs right in our own backyard, for material that needs to be moved right out of our backyard, for private land and Federal land? What do you think we can do more in that area for biomass?	What do you think we can do more in that area for biomass?

11426003139	1011	I don't have a precise count of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.

11525545134	101100	Regarding the organic issue, certainly, that has become a valuable brand as we see the growth from consumers wanting more of that. The way the oversight works on that from USDA is we authorize or legitimize the certifiers; many times state agencies, to go out and make sure the principles and the processes and the programs that define organic are being carried out. As you might imagine, that is not a 24/7-type inspection. It works much like the Environmental Protection Agency authorizes state EPDs to work in that regard as well.    That is a challenge. Our goal is to have better education of these authorizing certifiers, and to maybe do some auditing out here, not only of the certifiers, but on the ground as well, to do that. We want to jealously guard the legitimate. And there is some legitimate concern regarding cheaters coming into the country with organic labels, that aren't following organic processes. It is a very important responsibility of USDA. We have to leverage that because there is no way for USDA to have enough inspectors on the ground everywhere to certify organics. But in working with our authorized certifiers, and we will just try to do a better job in making sure those people who are violating the rules are not allowed to continue to do that.	Well, we appreciate that.    In addition, we have a large cattle industry in and around my district, including the largest herd in the nation at Deseret Ranch, and we appreciate your commitment to help modernize the North American FMD vaccine bank. I do want to bring to your attention what you may already know, we had a small screwworm outbreak in the Keys, which was a pretty strange place for that to happen. While that is under control, it just highlights that we still have risk to Florida cattle.    And one other thing I know my local cattle ranchers will be sending you an invite to the RAM Rodeo in Osceola County. I encourage you to come along if you can make it, or one of our others. It is part of our tradition there.    The other issue I wanted to bring up is there has been reports that foreign farmers are bringing in fruits and vegetables labeled as organic, that are not organic. And in Florida, we are working on protecting a fruit and vegetable industry that is really struggling under low wages coming through areas like Mexico and Central America.    It is a twofold question. What do you think we can do to assist in making sure organic means just that, particularly from foreign commodities, and what do you think we could do within the NAFTA confines to trigger higher wages under the existing provisions of NAFTA in Mexico and other areas?

All of the TIGTA report didn't blanket say you should never ask questions about this. Thank you for the chart.	Okay. Well, this is put out by the Exempt Organizations Division, same division where all these problems took place over the last three years. It came out, again, just five days after the comment period on the proposed rule ended at the end of February, and I want to just highlight a few of the questions that are asked. So there is a category that says what if the IRS needs more information about your (c)(4) application? New sample questions. So if we could put them up side-by-side.    Now, the first slide are the targeted questions that TIGTA said were inappropriate and that you agree are inappropriate, Judith Kendall agreed are inappropriate. Those are those questions. And now, just five days after the proposed rule comment period ends, you issue a newsletter from the Exempt Organizations Division highlighting the new questions you are going to ask, and I just want to look how similar the two questions are.    Let's just take the second category, whether an officer or director, etcetera, has run or will run for public office. The new question says this: Do you support a candidate for public office who is one of your founders, officers, or board members? It is basically the same. This reminds me of when I was in grade school and the teachers told us you shouldn't plagiarize, so you change a few words and basically plagiarize. This is the same thing.    So here is what I don't understand. If you are trying to comply with the TIGTA report, if the new (c)(4) rule is a way to deal with what the audit said and not as what I believe is a continuation of the project Lois Lerner started, why are you asking the same darn questions?

11420722157	111000	Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground. Everyone is committed to trying to determine what led this individual to take this heinous act.	Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.
